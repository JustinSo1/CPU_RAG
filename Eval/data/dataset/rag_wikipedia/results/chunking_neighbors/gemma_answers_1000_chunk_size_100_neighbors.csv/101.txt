[PROMPT]: Is he most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any relevant information about the person's contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead comments on the lack of context, which makes it inaccurate and not factual based on the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the person's noted contributions without additional context considerations.
[RESULT]: 1
