[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election. Instead, it states that the knowledge base does not have a good match and then mentions answering based on its own knowledge without providing the actual answer. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "yes."
[RESULT]: 1
