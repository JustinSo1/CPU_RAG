[PROMPT]: Did the scientific community not reserve great attention to his theory ?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question asked. Instead, it provides an explanation about the limitations of the knowledge base, which is not relevant to the question. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should be straightforward and directly address the question. The evaluated response fails to do this and does not provide any factual information related to the question.
[RESULT]: 1
