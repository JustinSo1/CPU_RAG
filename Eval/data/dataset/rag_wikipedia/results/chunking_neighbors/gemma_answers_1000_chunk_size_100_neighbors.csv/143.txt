[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and does not provide a correct, accurate, or factual answer. The question asks whether the freezing point on a thermometer is 100, which is a factual question that requires a simple "yes" or "no" answer. The response fails to provide this information and instead gives an irrelevant statement about the knowledge base.
[RESULT]: 1
