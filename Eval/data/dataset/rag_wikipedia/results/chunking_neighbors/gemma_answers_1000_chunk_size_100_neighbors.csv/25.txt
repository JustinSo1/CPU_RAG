[PROMPT]: What trail did Lincoln use a Farmers' Almanac in? 
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lincoln using a Farmers' Almanac, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: he defended William "Duff" Armstrong
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead of identifying the specific trial where Lincoln used a Farmers' Almanac, the response states that the context does not provide the information. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
