[PROMPT]: Did Abraham Lincoln live in the Frontier?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Abraham Lincoln's residence, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that Abraham Lincoln did live in the Frontier. The response fails to provide this factual information and is therefore completely incorrect based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
