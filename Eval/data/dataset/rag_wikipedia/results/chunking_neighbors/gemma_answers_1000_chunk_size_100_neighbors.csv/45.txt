[PROMPT]: When was the first photgraph of lincoln taken?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the first photograph of Lincoln, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1846
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the task of providing the year of the first photograph of Lincoln. The correct answer, "1846," is not mentioned at all, making the response completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
