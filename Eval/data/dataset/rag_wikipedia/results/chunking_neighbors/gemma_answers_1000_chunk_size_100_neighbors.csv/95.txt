[PROMPT]: Was Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro an Italian savant?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro's intelligence or savant-like abilities, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide enough information to determine whether Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro was an Italian savant. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Avogadro was indeed an Italian savant. Therefore, the response is not accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
