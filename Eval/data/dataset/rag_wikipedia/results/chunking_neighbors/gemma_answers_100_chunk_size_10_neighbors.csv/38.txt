[PROMPT]: Did the scientific community not reserve great attention to his theory ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the scientific community did not reserve great attention to his theory. The context states that Newton's theory of gravity was not widely accepted at the time and that he did not receive much recognition for his work.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly addresses the question by stating that the scientific community did not reserve great attention to his theory. However, it includes additional context about Newton's theory of gravity, which is not necessary for the response. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that a concise response would be more appropriate. The additional context does not detract from the accuracy but makes the response more elaborate than needed.
[RESULT]: 4
