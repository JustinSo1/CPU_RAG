[PROMPT]: Was Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro an Italian savant?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro being an Italian savant. Instead, it states that there is no information provided in the context, which is not relevant to the task of evaluating the factual accuracy of the statement. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Avogadro was indeed an Italian savant. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
