[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln sign the National Banking Act of 1863?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Abraham Lincoln signed the National Banking Act of 1863, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Abraham Lincoln signed the National Banking Act of 1863. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of information but does not provide the factual answer that Lincoln did sign the act. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
