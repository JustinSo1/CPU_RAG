[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln sign the National Banking Act of 1863?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Abraham Lincoln signed the National Banking Act of 1863, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "yes," indicating that Abraham Lincoln did sign the National Banking Act of 1863. The evaluated response, however, states that the context does not provide information to answer the question, which is not aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate.
