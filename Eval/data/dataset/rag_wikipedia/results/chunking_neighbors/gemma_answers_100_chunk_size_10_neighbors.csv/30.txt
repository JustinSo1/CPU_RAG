[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln win the election of 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, here's the answer to the question:

Yes, Lincoln was re-elected as the 16th President of the United States in 1860, winning all but two states.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct in stating that Lincoln won the election of 1860. However, it inaccurately mentions that Lincoln was re-elected and that he won all but two states, which is not factual. Lincoln was elected for the first time in 1860, not re-elected, and he did not win all but two states. This makes the response somewhat correct but with significant inaccuracies.
[RESULT]: 3
