[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the thermometer's freezing point, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that there is no information provided in the context to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of context but does not provide the factual answer that the reference answer does. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
