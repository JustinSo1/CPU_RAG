[PROMPT]: Who graduated in ecclesiastical law at the early age of 20 and began to practice?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about who graduated in ecclesiastical law at the early age of 20 and began to practice, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Amedeo Avogadro

Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question, which is not accurate based on the reference answer. The correct answer is "Amedeo Avogadro," and the response fails to mention this. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate.
