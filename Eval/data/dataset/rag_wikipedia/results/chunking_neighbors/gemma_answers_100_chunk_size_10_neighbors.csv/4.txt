[PROMPT]: How many long was Lincoln's formal education?
[USER_ANSWER]: Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling, primarily self-educated.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 18 months
[FEEDBACK]: The response "Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling, primarily self-educated" is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states the duration of Lincoln's formal education as 18 months, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about him being primarily self-educated, while true, is not directly relevant to the question asked. This extra detail does not detract significantly from the accuracy of the response but does make it slightly more verbose than necessary.
[RESULT]: 4
