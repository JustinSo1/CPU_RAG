[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. The reference answer indicates that Lincoln used a Farmers' Almanac in the trial where he defended William "Duff" Armstrong. The response fails to mention this and instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is not accurate based on the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual.
