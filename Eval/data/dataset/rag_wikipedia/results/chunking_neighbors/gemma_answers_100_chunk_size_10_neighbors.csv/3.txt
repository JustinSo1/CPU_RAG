[PROMPT]: Did his mother die of pneumonia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Coolidge's mother died of pneumonia, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of information, but it does not provide the factual answer "no" as required by the reference answer. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
