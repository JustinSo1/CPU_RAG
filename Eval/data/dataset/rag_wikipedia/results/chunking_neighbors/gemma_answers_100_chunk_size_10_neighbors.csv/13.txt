[PROMPT]: Which county was Lincoln born in?
[USER_ANSWER]: Lincoln was born in Hardin County, southeast of Springfield.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Hardin County
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Hardin County as the place where Lincoln was born, which matches the reference answer. However, the additional information "southeast of Springfield" is not necessary and could be misleading, as it is not directly relevant to the question. This extra detail slightly detracts from the accuracy and precision of the response.
[RESULT]: 4
