[PROMPT]: Was Abraham Lincoln the first President of the United States?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the first President of the United States, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question "Was Abraham Lincoln the first President of the United States?" Instead, it states that the context does not provide information to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of context, but it fails to provide the factual answer "No," which is required for full accuracy. Therefore, the response is not completely correct or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
