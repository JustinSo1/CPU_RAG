[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether John Trinity published a collection in 1738. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question with a simple "No" as the reference answer does. Instead, it provides an explanation about the lack of context, which is not required. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
