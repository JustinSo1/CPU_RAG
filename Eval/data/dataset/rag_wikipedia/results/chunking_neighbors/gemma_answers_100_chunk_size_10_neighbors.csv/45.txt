[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the thermometer's freezing point, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that the thermometer had 100 for the freezing point. The evaluated response, however, states that there is no information provided about the thermometer's freezing point, which contradicts the reference answer. Therefore, the response does not align with the correct information given in the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
