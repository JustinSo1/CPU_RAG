[PROMPT]: What did The Legal Tender Act of 1862 establish?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, here's an answer to the question:

The Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in the United States since the suspension of specie payment in 1862.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual. It accurately states that the Legal Tender Act of 1862 established the United States Note, the first paper currency in the United States. However, the mention of "since the suspension of specie payment in 1862" is unnecessary and slightly misleading, as the reference answer does not include this detail. The core information is correct, but the additional detail slightly detracts from the precision of the response.
[RESULT]: 4
