[PROMPT]: Was King Victor Emmanuel III there to pay homage to Avogadro ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether King Victor Emmanuel III paid homage to Avogadro in 1911. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "yes," indicating that King Victor Emmanuel III was there to pay homage to Avogadro. The evaluated response, however, states that there is no information provided about this, which contradicts the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
