[PROMPT]: Was Anders Celsius (November 27, 1701 April 25, 1744) a Swedish astronomer?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, Anders Celsius was a Swedish astronomer. The context provides the birth and death dates of Celsius, which are both Swedish.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Anders Celsius as a Swedish astronomer, which is accurate and factual. However, the additional information about the birth and death dates being "Swedish" is unnecessary and somewhat confusing, as dates themselves cannot be attributed to a nationality. This extra detail slightly detracts from the overall accuracy and clarity of the response.
[RESULT]: 4
