[PROMPT]: When did he become a professor?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about when he became a professor, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1820
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states that he became a professor in 1820, while the response claims that the context does not provide this information. This indicates a lack of accuracy and factual correctness in the response.
[RESULT]: 1
