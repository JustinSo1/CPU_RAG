[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln ever represent Alton & Sangamon Railroad?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Abraham Lincoln ever represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a correct or accurate answer to the question. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Abraham Lincoln did represent the Alton & Sangamon Railroad. The evaluated response fails to acknowledge this fact and instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the correctness of the answer itself. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
