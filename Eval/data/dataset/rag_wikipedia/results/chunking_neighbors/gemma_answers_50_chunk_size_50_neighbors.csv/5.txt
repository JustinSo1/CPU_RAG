[PROMPT]: When did Lincoln begin his political career?
[USER_ANSWER]: According to the context, Lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 10.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1832
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. While it correctly identifies the year 1832, it inaccurately states that Lincoln was 10 years old at that time. Lincoln was actually born in 1809, making him 23 years old in 1832. This significant error in age makes the response mostly incorrect.
[RESULT]: 2
