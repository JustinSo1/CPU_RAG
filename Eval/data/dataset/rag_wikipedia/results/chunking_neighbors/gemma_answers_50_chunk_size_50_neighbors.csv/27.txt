[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln's Wife's Family support slavery?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln's wife's family supported slavery. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Lincoln's wife's family did support slavery. The evaluated response, however, claims that there is no information provided to answer the question, which contradicts the reference answer. Therefore, the response does not align with the factual information given in the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
