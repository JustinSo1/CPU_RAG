[PROMPT]: How many long was Lincoln's formal education?
[USER_ANSWER]: Lincoln's formal education was about 18 m of formal education.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 18 months
[FEEDBACK]: The response "Lincoln's formal education was about 18 m of formal education" is mostly correct in terms of the duration of Lincoln's formal education. However, the use of "m" instead of "months" makes the response slightly unclear and less precise. The reference answer clearly states "18 months," which is more accurate and factual. Therefore, the response is not completely correct and accurate but is mostly correct.
[RESULT]: 4
