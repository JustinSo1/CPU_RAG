[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln's Wife's Family support slavery?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln's wife's family supported slavery. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead states that there is no information provided in the context to determine the answer. This is not aligned with the reference answer, which is a definitive "Yes." Therefore, the response is completely incorrect based on the reference answer.
