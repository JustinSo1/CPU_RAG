[PROMPT]: Did lincoln have 18 months of schooling?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the number of months Lincoln spent in school, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a correct or factual answer to the question. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Lincoln did have 18 months of schooling. The response fails to address this fact and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
