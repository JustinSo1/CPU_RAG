[PROMPT]: Did his mother die of pneumonia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Wilson Roosevelt's mother died of pneumonia. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of information in the context provided. However, it does not directly answer the question with a simple "no" as the reference answer does. The response is more elaborate than necessary and does not align perfectly with the reference answer, which is concise and direct.
[RESULT]: 3
