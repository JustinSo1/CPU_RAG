[PROMPT]: How old was Lincoln in 1816?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lincoln's age in 1816, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: seven
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead of stating Lincoln's age in 1816, it mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the task. The correct answer is "seven," and the response fails to provide this information. Therefore, it is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
