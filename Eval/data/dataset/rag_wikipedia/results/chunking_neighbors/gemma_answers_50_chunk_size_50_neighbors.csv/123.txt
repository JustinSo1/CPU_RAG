[PROMPT]: Did the scientific community not reserve great attention to his theory ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the scientific community did not reserve great attention to his theory. The context does not provide any information about the scientific community's reception of Newton's theory.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct in stating that the scientific community did not reserve great attention to his theory, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional context about Newton's theory is unnecessary and not directly relevant to the question. This extra information does not detract significantly from the accuracy but does make the response less concise than the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
