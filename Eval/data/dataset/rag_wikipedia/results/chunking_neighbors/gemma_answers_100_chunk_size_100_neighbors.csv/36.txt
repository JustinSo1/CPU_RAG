[PROMPT]: Was King Victor Emmanuel III there to pay homage to Avogadro ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about King Victor Emmanuel III paying homage to Avogadro, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates a simple "yes" to the question, while the response states that there is no information provided in the context. This directly contradicts the reference answer, which implies that the information is available and affirmative. Therefore, the response does not align with the reference answer at all.
[RESULT]: 1
