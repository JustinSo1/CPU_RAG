[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the first photograph of Abraham Lincoln, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.

The correct answer, "1846," is not mentioned at all. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
