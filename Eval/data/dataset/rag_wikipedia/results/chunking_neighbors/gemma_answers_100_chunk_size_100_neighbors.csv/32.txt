[PROMPT]: Is it true that he became a professor in 1820?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Faraday becoming a professor in 1820, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question "Is it true that he became a professor in 1820?" Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about Faraday becoming a professor in 1820. This does not align with the reference answer, which is a straightforward "yes." Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
