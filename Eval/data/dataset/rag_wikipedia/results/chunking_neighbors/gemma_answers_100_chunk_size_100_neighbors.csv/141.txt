[PROMPT]: When did he publish a collection?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about when Theodore Roosevelt published a collection of his writings, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1733
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and does not provide the factual information that the collection was published in 1733. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information, which is not aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
