[PROMPT]: Can the title of this famous 1811 paper be roughly translated into english?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the title of the 1811 paper can be roughly translated into English as:

"The Law of Avogadro" or "The Law of Constant Volume".
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed translation of the title of the 1811 paper, which is more information than the reference answer. However, the reference answer is very brief and does not specify the title. The response is mostly correct and factual, but it includes additional information that was not requested. The titles "The Law of Avogadro" and "The Law of Constant Volume" are related to Avogadro's work, but the reference answer suggests a simpler response would be sufficient.
[RESULT]: 4
