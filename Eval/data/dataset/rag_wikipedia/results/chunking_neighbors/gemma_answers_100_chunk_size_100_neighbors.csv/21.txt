[PROMPT]: Was Lincoln chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Abraham Lincoln was chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The question is asking for a factual piece of information about Abraham Lincoln being chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860, and the correct answer is simply "Yes." The response fails to provide this factual information and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
