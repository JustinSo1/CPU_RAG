[PROMPT]: What is named after him?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the name of Abraham Lincoln, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The Celsius crater on the Moon
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any correct, accurate, or factual information based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that the Celsius crater on the Moon is named after him, but the response fails to mention this and instead states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
