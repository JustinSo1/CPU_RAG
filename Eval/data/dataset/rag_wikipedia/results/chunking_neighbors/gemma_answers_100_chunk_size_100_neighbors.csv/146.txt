[PROMPT]: Is The Celsius crater on the Moon named after him?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the Celsius crater on the Moon being named after Anders Celsius, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead mentions the lack of context, which makes it inaccurate and not factual based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that the Celsius crater on the Moon is indeed named after Anders Celsius. Therefore, the response fails to provide the correct and factual information required.
[RESULT]: 1
