[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Isaac Newton published a collection in 1738, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response indicates that the context does not provide information about whether Isaac Newton published a collection in 1738, which is not a direct answer to the question. The reference answer is a simple "No," which directly addresses the question. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct in acknowledging the lack of information but does not provide the direct answer required.
[RESULT]: 3
