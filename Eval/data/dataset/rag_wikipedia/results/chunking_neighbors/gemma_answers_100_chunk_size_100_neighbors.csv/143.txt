[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the freezing point of Anders Celsius's thermometer, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The question asks about the freezing point on a thermometer, specifically referring to the Celsius scale, where the freezing point is 0 degrees, not 100. The response does not address this fact and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer.
[RESULT]: 1
