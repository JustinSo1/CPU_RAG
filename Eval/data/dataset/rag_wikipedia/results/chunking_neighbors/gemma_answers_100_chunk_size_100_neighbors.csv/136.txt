[PROMPT]: What happened in 1833?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about what happened in 1833, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Avogadro had been recalled to Turin university
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about what happened in 1833. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question. The reference answer clearly states that Avogadro had been recalled to Turin university in 1833, which is a specific historical fact. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
