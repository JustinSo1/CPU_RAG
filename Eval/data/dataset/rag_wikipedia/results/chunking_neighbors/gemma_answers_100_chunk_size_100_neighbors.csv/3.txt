[PROMPT]: Did his mother die of pneumonia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether President Theodore Roosevelt's mother died of pneumonia. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of context to answer the question. However, it does not directly answer the question with a simple "no," which is the expected response based on the reference answer. The response is accurate in stating that the context does not provide the information, but it does not fully align with the reference answer's directness and simplicity.
[RESULT]: 3
