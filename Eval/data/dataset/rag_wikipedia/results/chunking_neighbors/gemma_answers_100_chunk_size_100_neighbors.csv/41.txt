[PROMPT]: Was Lincoln chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Abraham Lincoln was chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual. The question asks whether Lincoln was chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860, and the correct answer is simply "Yes." The response incorrectly states that there is no information provided to answer the question, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer itself.
[RESULT]: 1
