[PROMPT]: Did the scientific community not reserve great attention to his theory ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether the scientific community did not reserve great attention to Avogadro's hypothesis, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that there is no context provided to determine the answer, which deviates from the expected response. Therefore, it is not accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
