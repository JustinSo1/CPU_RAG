[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln's Wife's Family support slavery?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the support of Lincoln's wife's family towards slavery, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes

The response, however, states that there is no information provided to answer the question, which is not accurate based on the reference answer.
