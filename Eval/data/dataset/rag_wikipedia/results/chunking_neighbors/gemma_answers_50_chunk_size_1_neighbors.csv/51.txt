[PROMPT]: Did Abraham Lincoln live in the Frontier?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any relevant information about the location of Abraham Lincoln's residence during his life, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Abraham Lincoln lived in the Frontier. The evaluated response fails to provide this information and is therefore completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
