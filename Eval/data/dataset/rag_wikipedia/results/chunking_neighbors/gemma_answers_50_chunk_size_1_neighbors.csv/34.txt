[PROMPT]: Why did Lincoln issue the Emancipation Proclamation?
[USER_ANSWER]: The Emancipation Proclamation was issued by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862 during the American Civil War to emancipate all slaves in the Confederate states, freeing them from slavery and granting them the right to freedom.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: To free slaves 
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately states that the Emancipation Proclamation was issued by President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War and that it aimed to emancipate slaves in the Confederate states. However, it includes additional details about the year it was issued and the broader context, which, while accurate, are not necessary to answer the question directly. The core reason for issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, as stated in the reference answer, is to free slaves. The response captures this but adds extra context that is not required for a perfect score based on the rubric.
[RESULT]: 4
