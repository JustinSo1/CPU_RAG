[PROMPT]: Is it true that he became a professor in 1820?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a clear answer to the question. Instead, it states that the knowledge base does not have the information and then vaguely mentions answering based on its own knowledge without providing a definitive answer. This makes the response inaccurate and not factual in the context of the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
