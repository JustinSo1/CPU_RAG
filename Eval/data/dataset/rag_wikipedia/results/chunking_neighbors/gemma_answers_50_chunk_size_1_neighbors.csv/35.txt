[PROMPT]: Is he most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the person's contributions to the theories of molarity and molecular weight, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead comments on the lack of context, which deviates from the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the person is noted for their contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight. The evaluated response fails to provide this information and is therefore not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
