[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln win the election of 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election. Instead, it mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," which is factual and directly addresses the question. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
