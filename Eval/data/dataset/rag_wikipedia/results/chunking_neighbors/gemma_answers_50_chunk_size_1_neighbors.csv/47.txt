[PROMPT]: Was Anders Celsius (November 27, 1701 April 25, 1744) a Swedish astronomer?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Anders Celsius was a Swedish astronomer. The context provides the birth and death dates of Anders Celsius, which are both Swedish.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Anders Celsius as a Swedish astronomer, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about the birth and death dates being Swedish is inaccurate and irrelevant to the question. This extra detail does not contribute to the accuracy of the response and slightly detracts from its correctness. Therefore, while the main point is correct, the additional information is not accurate.
[RESULT]: 4
