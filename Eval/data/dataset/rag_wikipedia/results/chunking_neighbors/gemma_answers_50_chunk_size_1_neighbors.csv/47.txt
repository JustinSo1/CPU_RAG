[PROMPT]: Was Anders Celsius (November 27, 1701 April 25, 1744) a Swedish astronomer?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Anders Celsius was a Swedish astronomer. The context provides the birth and death dates of Anders Celsius, which are both Swedish.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Anders Celsius as a Swedish astronomer, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about the birth and death dates being Swedish is unnecessary and somewhat inaccurate, as dates themselves cannot be Swedish. This extra detail slightly detracts from the overall accuracy and conciseness of the response.
[RESULT]: 4
