[PROMPT]: Is it true that he became a professor in 1820?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead provides an explanation about the knowledge base. It does not confirm or deny whether he became a professor in 1820, making it inaccurate and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
