[PROMPT]: Did lincoln have 18 months of schooling?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context does not specify whether Lincoln spent 18 months in school, so I would answer that he did have 18 months of schooling.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of context specifying Lincoln's schooling duration. However, it inaccurately concludes that Lincoln did have 18 months of schooling, which is not supported by the reference answer. The response is not completely incorrect but contains inaccuracies that affect its factual correctness.
[RESULT]: 3
