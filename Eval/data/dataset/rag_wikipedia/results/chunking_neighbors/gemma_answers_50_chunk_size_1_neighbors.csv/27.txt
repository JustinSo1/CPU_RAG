[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln's Wife's Family support slavery?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a direct answer to the question about whether Lincoln's wife's family supported slavery. Instead, it states an inability to find a match in the knowledge base and relies on the responder's own knowledge without providing any factual information. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a clear "Yes."
[RESULT]: 1
