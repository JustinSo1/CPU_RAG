[PROMPT]: When did Lincoln first serve as President?
[USER_ANSWER]: According to the context, Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 10, and served as President from 1861 to 1865.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: March 4, 1861
[FEEDBACK]: The response contains some factual inaccuracies. Lincoln did not begin his political career in 1832 at age 10; he was born in 1809, which would make him 23 years old in 1832. Additionally, the response does correctly state that Lincoln served as President from 1861 to 1865, but it does not provide the specific date he first took office, which is March 4, 1861. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
