[PROMPT]: When did Lincoln first serve as President?
[USER_ANSWER]: According to the context, Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 10, and served as President from 1861 to 1865.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: March 4, 1861
[FEEDBACK]: The response contains some correct information, such as the years Lincoln served as President (1861 to 1865). However, it inaccurately states that Lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 10, which is incorrect. The response does not directly answer the question of when Lincoln first served as President with the specific date of March 4, 1861. Therefore, it is somewhat correct but lacks accuracy and completeness.
[RESULT]: 3
