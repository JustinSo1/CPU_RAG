[PROMPT]: Who was the first to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at the definition of an international temperature scale on scientific grounds ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about who was the first to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at defining an international temperature scale on scientific grounds, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Anders Celsius
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question, which is not relevant to the task of identifying the first person to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at defining an international temperature scale on scientific grounds. The correct answer is "Anders Celsius," and the response fails to mention this. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
