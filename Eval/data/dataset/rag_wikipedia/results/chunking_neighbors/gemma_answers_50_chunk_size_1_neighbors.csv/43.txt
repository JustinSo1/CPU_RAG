[PROMPT]: When did he publish a collection?
[USER_ANSWER]: According to the context, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published a collection of essays and poems called "Memoirs of a Country Doctor" in 1733.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1733
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides the correct year, 1733, which matches the reference answer. However, it includes additional information about Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and the title "Memoirs of a Country Doctor," which is not required and may not be accurate. The instruction only asked for the year of publication, and the extra details could potentially introduce inaccuracies. Therefore, while the year is correct, the additional context is unnecessary and could be misleading.
[RESULT]: 4
