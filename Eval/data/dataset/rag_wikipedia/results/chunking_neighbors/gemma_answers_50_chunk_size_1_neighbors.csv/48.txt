[PROMPT]: Is The Celsius crater on the Moon named after him?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the name Celsius and whether the Celsius crater on the Moon is named after him, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that the Celsius crater on the Moon is named after him. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
