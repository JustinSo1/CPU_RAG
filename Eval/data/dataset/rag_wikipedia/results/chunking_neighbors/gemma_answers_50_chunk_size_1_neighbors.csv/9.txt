[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election. Instead, it states that the knowledge base did not have a match and provides no factual information. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
