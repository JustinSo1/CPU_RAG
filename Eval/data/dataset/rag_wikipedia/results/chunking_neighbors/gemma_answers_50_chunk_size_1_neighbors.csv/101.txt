[PROMPT]: Is he most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the person's contributions to the theories of molarity and molecular weight, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead comments on the lack of context. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the person's noted contributions. Therefore, the response is not accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
