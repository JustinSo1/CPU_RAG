[PROMPT]: Is he most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro is most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual, as it identifies Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro and mentions his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight. However, the response is more verbose than necessary and does not match the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "yes," which is completely correct and factual. The evaluated response, while accurate, adds unnecessary context that was not required by the instruction.
[RESULT]: 4
