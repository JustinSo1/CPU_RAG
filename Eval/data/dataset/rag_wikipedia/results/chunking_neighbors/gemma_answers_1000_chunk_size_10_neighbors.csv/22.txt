[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln ever represent Alton & Sangamon Railroad?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does provide relevant information, so I can answer this question.

Yes, Lincoln represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Lincoln represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it includes additional information about the dispute with a shareholder, which, while accurate, is not necessary for the response. The extra detail does not detract from the correctness but is not required based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
