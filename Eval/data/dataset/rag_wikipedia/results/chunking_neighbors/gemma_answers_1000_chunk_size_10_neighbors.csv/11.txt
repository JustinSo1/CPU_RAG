[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln start his political career in 1832?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, Lincoln began his political career in 1832. The context states that he became a leader of the Illinois Whig party and served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives in that year.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Lincoln began his political career in 1832, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about Lincoln becoming a leader of the Illinois Whig party and serving four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives in that year is not entirely accurate. Lincoln did not serve four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives in 1832; he was first elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1834. This additional information, while related, introduces inaccuracies that prevent the response from being completely correct.
[RESULT]: 4
