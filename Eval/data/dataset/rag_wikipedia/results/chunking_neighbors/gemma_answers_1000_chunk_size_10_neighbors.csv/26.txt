[PROMPT]: Did Abraham Lincoln live in the Frontier?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Abraham Lincoln lived in the frontier, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not answer the question directly and instead states that the context does not provide information. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that Abraham Lincoln did live in the frontier. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
