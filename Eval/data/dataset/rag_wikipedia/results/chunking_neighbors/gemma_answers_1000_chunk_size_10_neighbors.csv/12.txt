Yes, Lincoln represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Lincoln represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional detail about the dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret, while accurate, is not necessary for the response and slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer.
