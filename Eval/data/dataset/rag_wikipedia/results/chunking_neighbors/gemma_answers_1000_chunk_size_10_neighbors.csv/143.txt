[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the freezing point of a thermometer, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the statement. Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
