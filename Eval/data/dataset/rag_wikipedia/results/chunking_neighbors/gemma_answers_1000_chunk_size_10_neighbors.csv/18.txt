[PROMPT]: Was Abraham Lincoln the first President of the United States?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any relevant information about whether Abraham Lincoln was the first President of the United States, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No

Instead, it states that the context does not provide relevant information, which is not necessary for answering this factual question. The correct answer is simply "No," as Abraham Lincoln was not the first President. Therefore, the response is not accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
