[PROMPT]: Did Abraham Lincoln live in the Frontier?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Abraham Lincoln lived in the frontier, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Abraham Lincoln did live in the frontier. The response, however, states that there is no information provided to answer the question, which is not aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate.
[RESULT]: 1
