[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Isaac Newton published a collection in 1738, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question with a simple "No" as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about the publication, which is not the same as providing a factual answer. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but not fully accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
