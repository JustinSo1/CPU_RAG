[PROMPT]: Was Abraham Lincoln the first President of the United States?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any relevant information about whether Abraham Lincoln was the first President of the United States, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. Instead, it mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer. The correct and factual answer is simply "No," as Abraham Lincoln was not the first President of the United States. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
