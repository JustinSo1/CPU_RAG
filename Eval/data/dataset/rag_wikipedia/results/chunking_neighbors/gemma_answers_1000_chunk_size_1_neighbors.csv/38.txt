[PROMPT]: Did the scientific community not reserve great attention to his theory ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context does not provide any information about whether the scientific community did not reserve great attention to Avogadro's hypothesis, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide enough information to answer the question, which deviates from the expected simple affirmation. Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
