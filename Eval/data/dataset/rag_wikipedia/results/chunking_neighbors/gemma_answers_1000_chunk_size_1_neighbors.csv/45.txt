[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the temperature of the thermometer, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly address the question asked. The question is about the freezing point on a thermometer, which is a factual query. The correct answer is "Yes," indicating that the freezing point is 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit, not 100. The response provided does not give this factual information and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the question. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
