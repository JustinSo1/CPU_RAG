[PROMPT]: Why did Lincoln issue the Emancipation Proclamation?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the reason Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: To free slaves 
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the task. The reference answer clearly states that Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation to free slaves. The evaluated response does not provide this information and is therefore completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
