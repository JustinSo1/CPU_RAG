[PROMPT]: Did his mother die of pneumonia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the death of Roosevelt's mother of pneumonia, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of information in the context provided. However, it does not directly answer the question with a simple "no" as the reference answer does. The response adds unnecessary information about the context, which is not required for this specific question. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
