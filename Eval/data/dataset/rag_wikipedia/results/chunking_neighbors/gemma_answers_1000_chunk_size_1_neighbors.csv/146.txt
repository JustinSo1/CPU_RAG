[PROMPT]: Is The Celsius crater on the Moon named after him?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the name Celsius and whether the Celsius crater on the Moon is named after him, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a direct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about the name Celsius and whether the Celsius crater on the Moon is named after him. This is not aligned with the reference answer, which is a simple "Yes." Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
