[PROMPT]: What trail did Lincoln use a Farmers' Almanac in? 
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the trail Lincoln used a Farmers' Almanac in, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: he defended William "Duff" Armstrong
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. The reference answer indicates that Lincoln used a Farmers' Almanac in the trial where he defended William "Duff" Armstrong. The response instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer itself. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
