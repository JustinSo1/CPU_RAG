[PROMPT]: When did Lincoln begin his political career?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, here's the answer:

Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1832
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies the year 1832 as the beginning of Lincoln's political career, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it includes additional details about his age, the nature of his campaign, and his political affiliation, which, while accurate, are not necessary for the answer. The extra information does not detract from the correctness but is not required based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
