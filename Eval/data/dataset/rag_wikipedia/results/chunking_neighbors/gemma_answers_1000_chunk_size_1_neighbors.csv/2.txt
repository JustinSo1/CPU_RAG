[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln sign the National Banking Act of 1863?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln signed the National Banking Act of 1863, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Lincoln did sign the National Banking Act of 1863. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
