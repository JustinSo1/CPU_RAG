[PROMPT]: Was Celsius born in Uppsala in Sweden?

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Celsius was born in Uppsala, Sweden, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about Celsius being a professor of astronomy at Uppsala University from 1730 to 1744, while factual, is not directly relevant to the question asked. This extra detail does not detract from the correctness of the response but is unnecessary for the specific question.
