[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the temperature of the thermometer, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The question is asking about the freezing point on a thermometer, which is a factual question. The correct answer is simply "No," as the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit, not 100. The response does not address the factual aspect of the question and instead mentions the lack of context, which is irrelevant to the factual nature of the question.
[RESULT]: 2
