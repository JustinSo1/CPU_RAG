[PROMPT]: Who determined the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, Anders Celsius was the first to conduct careful experiments to define the international temperature scale on scientific grounds. He determined the dependence of the boiling point of water with atmospheric pressure, and gave a rule for determining the boiling point under different atmospheric conditions.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Anders Celsius
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Anders Celsius as the person who determined the dependence of the boiling point of water with atmospheric pressure, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about Celsius defining the international temperature scale and giving a rule for determining the boiling point under different atmospheric conditions, while informative, is not directly relevant to the question asked. This extra detail does not detract from the accuracy of the response but is not necessary for a complete answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 4
