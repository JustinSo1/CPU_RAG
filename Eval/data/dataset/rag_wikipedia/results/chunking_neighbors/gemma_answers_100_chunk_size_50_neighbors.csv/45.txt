[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the temperature of the thermometer, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that the freezing point is 100 for the thermometer in question. The response, however, states that there is no information provided about the temperature of the thermometer, which contradicts the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate.
[RESULT]: 1
