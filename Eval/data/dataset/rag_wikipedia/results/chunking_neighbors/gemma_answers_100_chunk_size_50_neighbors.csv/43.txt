[PROMPT]: When did he publish a collection?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about when Theodore Roosevelt published a collection of his writings, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1733
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates a specific year (1733), while the response claims that there is no information provided about the publication date. This shows a lack of alignment with the factual information required by the question.
[RESULT]: 1
