[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln win the election of 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that Abraham Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States in 1860, winning all but two states.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Abraham Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States in 1860. However, the additional detail about winning all but two states is not necessary and slightly inaccurate, as Lincoln did not win all but two states; he won a majority of the electoral votes but not the popular vote in many Southern states. The reference answer is more concise and directly answers the question.
[RESULT]: 4
