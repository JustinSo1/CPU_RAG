[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln win the election of 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that Abraham Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States in 1860, winning all but two states.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Abraham Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States in 1860. However, the additional detail about winning all but two states is not entirely accurate, as Lincoln won 18 out of 33 states. This extra information, while mostly correct, introduces a slight inaccuracy.
[RESULT]: 4
