[PROMPT]: Is he most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that Avogadro is most remembered for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual, as it states that Avogadro is remembered for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight. However, the response adds extra context ("the context says") that is not necessary and slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer. The reference answer is a straightforward "yes," while the evaluated response adds additional, albeit accurate, information. This makes the response mostly correct but not completely aligned with the reference answer's simplicity and directness.
[RESULT]: 4
