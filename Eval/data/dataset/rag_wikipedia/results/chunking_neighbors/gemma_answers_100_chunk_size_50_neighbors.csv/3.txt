[PROMPT]: Did his mother die of pneumonia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the death of Hannah Ayscough Wilson, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response indicates that the context does not provide information about the death of Hannah Ayscough Wilson, which is not directly answering the question. The reference answer is a simple "no," which is a direct and factual response. The evaluated response, while not incorrect, does not directly address the question with the same clarity and simplicity as the reference answer. Therefore, it is somewhat correct but not fully aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
