[PROMPT]: Did his mother die of pneumonia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the death of Hannah Ayscough Wilson, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of information in the provided context. However, it does not directly answer the question with a simple "no," which is the expected response based on the reference answer. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
