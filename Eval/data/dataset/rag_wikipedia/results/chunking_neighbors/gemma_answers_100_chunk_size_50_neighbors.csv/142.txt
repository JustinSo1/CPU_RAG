[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Isaac Newton publishing a collection in 1738, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it does not provide incorrect information, but it does not directly answer the question with a simple "No" as the reference answer does. The response adds unnecessary context about the lack of information provided, which is not required by the question. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
