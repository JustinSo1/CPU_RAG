[PROMPT]: Was King Victor Emmanuel III there to pay homage to Avogadro ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about King Victor Emmanuel III paying homage to Amedeo Avogadro, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that King Victor Emmanuel III was there to pay homage to Avogadro. The evaluated response, however, states that there is no information provided about this, which directly contradicts the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate.
[RESULT]: 1
