[PROMPT]: What happened in 1833?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.

In 1833, the United States Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, which prohibited the transportation of enslaved people across state lines. This act was a major step towards the abolition of slavery in the United States.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Avogadro had been recalled to Turin university
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that Avogadro was recalled to Turin university in 1833, while the response incorrectly states that the Fugitive Slave Act was passed in 1833. The Fugitive Slave Act was actually passed in 1850, not 1833. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual.
[RESULT]: 1
