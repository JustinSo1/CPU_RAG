[PROMPT]: What happened in 1833?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.

In 1833, the United States Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, which prohibited the transportation of enslaved people across state lines. This act was a major step towards the abolition of slavery in the United States.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Avogadro had been recalled to Turin university
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The Fugitive Slave Act was actually passed in 1850, not 1833. Additionally, the reference answer indicates that Avogadro was recalled to Turin University in 1833, which is not mentioned in the response. Therefore, the response does not align with the reference answer and contains factual inaccuracies.
[RESULT]: 1
