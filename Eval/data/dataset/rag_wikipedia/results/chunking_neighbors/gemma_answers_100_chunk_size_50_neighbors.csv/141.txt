[PROMPT]: When did he publish a collection?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about when Theodore Roosevelt published a collection of his writings, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1733
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct information about when the collection was published. The reference answer indicates the year 1733, but the response states that the context does not provide this information. This makes the response completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
