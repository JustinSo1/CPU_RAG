[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln ever represent Alton & Sangamon Railroad?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Abraham Lincoln ever represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Abraham Lincoln did represent the Alton & Sangamon Railroad. The evaluated response fails to provide this information and instead states that the context does not provide the necessary information, which is not aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
