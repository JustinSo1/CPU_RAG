[PROMPT]: Do scholars rank lincoln among the top three presidents?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, according to the context, Abraham Lincoln is considered a martyr by many historians due to his efforts to end slavery. Therefore, scholars rank him among the top three U.S. Presidents.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual, as it accurately states that scholars rank Abraham Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents. However, it includes additional context about Lincoln being considered a martyr due to his efforts to end slavery, which, while true, is not directly relevant to the question. The reference answer is more concise and directly addresses the question without additional context. Therefore, the response is not completely aligned with the reference answer but is still mostly correct and factual.
