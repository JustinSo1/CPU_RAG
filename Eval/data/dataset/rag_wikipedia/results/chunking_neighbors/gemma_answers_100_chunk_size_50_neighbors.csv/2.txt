[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln sign the National Banking Act of 1863?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln signed the National Banking Act of 1863, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "yes," indicating that Lincoln did sign the National Banking Act of 1863. The evaluated response fails to provide this factual information and instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the correctness of the answer.
[RESULT]: 1
