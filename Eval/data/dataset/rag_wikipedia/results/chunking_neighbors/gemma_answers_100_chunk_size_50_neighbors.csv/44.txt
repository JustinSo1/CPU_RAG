[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Isaac Newton publishing a collection in 1738, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of information in the context provided. However, it does not directly answer the question with a simple "No," which is the expected response according to the reference answer. The response is accurate in stating that the context does not provide the information, but it does not fully align with the reference answer's directness and simplicity.
[RESULT]: 3
