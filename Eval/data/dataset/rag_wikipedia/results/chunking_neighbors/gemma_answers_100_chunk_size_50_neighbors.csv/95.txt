[PROMPT]: Was Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro an Italian savant?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro was an Italian savant, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro was an Italian savant. Instead, it states that the context does not provide enough information to answer the question. This makes the response inaccurate and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "yes." The response fails to provide the correct information and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
