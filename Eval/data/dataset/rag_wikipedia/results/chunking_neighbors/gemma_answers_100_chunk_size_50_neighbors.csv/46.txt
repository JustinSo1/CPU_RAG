[PROMPT]: Was Celsius born in Uppsala in Sweden?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that Celsius was born in Uppsala, Sweden.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It confirms that Celsius was born in Uppsala, Sweden, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the response includes additional information ("the context says") that is not necessary for the answer. The reference answer is more concise and directly addresses the question with a simple "Yes." While the additional context does not make the response incorrect, it does make it slightly less direct than the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
