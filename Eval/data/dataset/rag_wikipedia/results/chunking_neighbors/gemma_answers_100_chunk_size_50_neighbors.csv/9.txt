[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The question asks for a factual answer about the 1860 election, and the correct response is simply "yes." The evaluated response does not provide this factual information and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the question.
[RESULT]: 2
