[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Johannes Kepler published a collection in 1738, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The question asks for a simple confirmation or denial about the publication of a collection in 1738. The reference answer is a straightforward "No," while the response provided does not directly address the question and instead mentions the lack of context. This makes the response inaccurate and not factual in relation to the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
