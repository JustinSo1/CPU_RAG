[PROMPT]: What trail did Lincoln use a Farmers' Almanac in? 
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the trail Lincoln used a Farmers' Almanac in, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: he defended William "Duff" Armstrong
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and does not provide any factual information related to the question. The reference answer clearly states that Lincoln used a Farmers' Almanac in the trial where he defended William "Duff" Armstrong, but the response fails to mention this and instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is not accurate.
[RESULT]: 1
