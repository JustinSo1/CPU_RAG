[PROMPT]: Was Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro an Italian savant?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro being an Italian savant. Instead, it mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Avogadro was indeed an Italian savant. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not meet the criteria for accuracy or factual correctness.
[RESULT]: 1
