[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the thermometer's freezing point, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that the freezing point is indeed 100 for the thermometer in question. The evaluated response, however, states that there is no information provided about the thermometer's freezing point, which contradicts the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate.
[RESULT]: 1
