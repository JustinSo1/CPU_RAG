[PROMPT]: Is The Celsius crater on the Moon named after him?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, The Celsius crater on the Moon is named after Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer and physicist.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that the Celsius crater on the Moon is named after Anders Celsius. However, the reference answer is very concise, and the additional information about Anders Celsius being a Swedish astronomer and physicist, while accurate, is not necessary to answer the question directly. This extra detail does not detract from the correctness but makes the response slightly more elaborate than needed.
[RESULT]: 4
