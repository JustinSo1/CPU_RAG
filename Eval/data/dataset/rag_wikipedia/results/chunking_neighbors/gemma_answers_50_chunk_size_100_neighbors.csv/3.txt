[PROMPT]: Did his mother die of pneumonia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether his mother died of pneumonia, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of information in the context, but it does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. The reference answer is a simple "no," which is clear and direct. The evaluated response, while accurate in its explanation, does not provide the straightforward answer that is expected. Therefore, it is not completely correct and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
