[PROMPT]: Is it true that he became a professor in 1820?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that Wilson became a professor of physics in 1820.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It confirms that Wilson became a professor in 1820, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional detail about Wilson becoming a professor of physics, while potentially accurate, is not necessary for the response and slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer. This additional information does not detract significantly from the correctness but does make the response slightly more complex than needed.
[RESULT]: 4
