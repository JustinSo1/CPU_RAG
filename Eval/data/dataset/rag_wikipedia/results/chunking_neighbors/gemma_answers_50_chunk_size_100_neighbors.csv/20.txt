[PROMPT]: Did lincoln have 18 months of schooling?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln had 18 months of schooling, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Lincoln had 18 months of schooling. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
