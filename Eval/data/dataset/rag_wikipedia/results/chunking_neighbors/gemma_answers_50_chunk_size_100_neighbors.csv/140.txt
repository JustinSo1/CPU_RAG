[PROMPT]: What is named after him?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, here's the answer to your question:

The context does not provide any information about the names of Abraham Lincoln, Nikola Tesla, or Stephen Grover, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The Celsius crater on the Moon
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any correct, accurate, or factual information related to the question "What is named after him?" The reference answer indicates that the correct response should be "The Celsius crater on the Moon," but the evaluated response does not mention this or any other relevant information. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about certain individuals, which is not relevant to the question asked. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
