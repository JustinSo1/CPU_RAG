[PROMPT]: How many long was Lincoln's formal education?
[USER_ANSWER]: Lincoln's formal education was about 18 m.

The context does not provide any other information about the length of his formal education.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 18 months
[FEEDBACK]: The response "Lincoln's formal education was about 18 m." is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. The abbreviation "m" for months is understandable but not as clear as the full word "months." The additional sentence about the context not providing other information is unnecessary and does not add value to the response. However, the main information provided is accurate and aligns with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
