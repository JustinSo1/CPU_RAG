[PROMPT]: How many long was Lincoln's formal education?
[USER_ANSWER]: Lincoln's formal education was about 18 m.

The context does not provide any other information about the length of his formal education.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 18 months
[FEEDBACK]: The response "Lincoln's formal education was about 18 m." is mostly correct in terms of the duration of Lincoln's formal education, which is 18 months. However, the use of "m" instead of "months" could lead to some confusion, as "m" is commonly used to denote meters. The additional sentence about the context not providing other information is unnecessary and does not contribute to the accuracy of the response.
[RESULT]: 4
