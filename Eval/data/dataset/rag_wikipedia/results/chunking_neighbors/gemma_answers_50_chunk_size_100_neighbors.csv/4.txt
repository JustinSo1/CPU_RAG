[PROMPT]: Did his mother die of pneumonia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether his mother died of pneumonia, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response to the question is not directly answering the question with a simple "no" as the reference answer does. Instead, it provides an explanation about the lack of context, which is not required. Therefore, the response is not completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer. It is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of information, but it does not provide the direct answer needed.
[RESULT]: 3
