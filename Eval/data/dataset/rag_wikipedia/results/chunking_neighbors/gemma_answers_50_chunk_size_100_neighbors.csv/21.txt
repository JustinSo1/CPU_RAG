[PROMPT]: Was Lincoln chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lincoln's 1860 presidential campaign and his political career leading up to that election, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about Lincoln being chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860. Instead, it mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer. The correct answer is a simple "Yes," which the response fails to provide. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
