[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The question asks for a factual answer about the 1860 election, and the correct answer is "yes," as Abraham Lincoln did indeed beat John C. Breckinridge. The response fails to provide this factual information and instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer.
[RESULT]: 2
