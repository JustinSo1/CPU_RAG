[PROMPT]: Can the title of this famous 1811 paper be roughly translated into english?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the title of the famous 1811 paper, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided does not directly answer the question. The instruction asks for a rough translation of the title of a famous 1811 paper, and the reference answer simply states "yes," indicating that it can be translated. The response instead discusses the lack of context, which is not relevant to the question asked. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
