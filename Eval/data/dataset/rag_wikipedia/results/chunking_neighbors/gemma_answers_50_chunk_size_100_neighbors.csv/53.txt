[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln's Wife's Family support slavery?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the support of Lincoln's wife's family on the issue of slavery, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead states that there is no information provided in the context to answer it. This is not aligned with the reference answer, which is a definitive "Yes." Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
