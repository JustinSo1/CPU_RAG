[PROMPT]: Was Anders Celsius (November 27, 1701 April 25, 1744) a Swedish astronomer?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any relevant information about Anders Celsius's nationality or profession, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about Anders Celsius's nationality or profession. Instead, it states that the context does not provide relevant information, which is not aligned with the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that Anders Celsius was indeed a Swedish astronomer. The response fails to provide this factual information and is therefore not accurate or correct based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
