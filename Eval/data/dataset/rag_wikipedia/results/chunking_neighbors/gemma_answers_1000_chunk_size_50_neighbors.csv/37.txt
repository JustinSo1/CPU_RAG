[PROMPT]: Is Avogadro 's number commonly used to compute the results of chemical reactions ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the commonly used value of Avogadro's number in computing the results of chemical reactions, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Avogadro's number is commonly used to compute the results of chemical reactions. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question itself. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the common use of Avogadro's number in chemical reactions. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
