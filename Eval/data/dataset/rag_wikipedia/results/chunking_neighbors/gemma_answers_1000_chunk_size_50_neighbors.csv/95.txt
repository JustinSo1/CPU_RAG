[PROMPT]: Was Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro an Italian savant?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro's intelligence or savant-like abilities, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that there is no information provided to determine Avogadro's intelligence or savant-like abilities. This makes the response somewhat correct in acknowledging the lack of context but ultimately fails to provide the simple affirmative answer given in the reference. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
