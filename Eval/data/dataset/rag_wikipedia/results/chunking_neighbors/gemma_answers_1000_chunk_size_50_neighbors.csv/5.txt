[PROMPT]: When did Lincoln begin his political career?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about when Lincoln began his political career, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1832
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. The reference answer clearly states that Lincoln began his political career in 1832, which the response fails to mention. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
