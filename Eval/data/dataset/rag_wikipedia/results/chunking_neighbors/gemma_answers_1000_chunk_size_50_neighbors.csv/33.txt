[PROMPT]: Was Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro an Italian savant?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro's intelligence or savant-like abilities, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro was an Italian savant. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about his intelligence or savant-like abilities. This makes the response mostly incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "yes." The response fails to address the question directly and accurately.
[RESULT]: 2
