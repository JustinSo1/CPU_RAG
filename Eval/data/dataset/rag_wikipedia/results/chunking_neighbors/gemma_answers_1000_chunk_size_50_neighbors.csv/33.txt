[PROMPT]: Was Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro an Italian savant?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro's intelligence or savant-like abilities, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro was an Italian savant. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information to answer the question, which is not aligned with the reference answer "yes." Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and does not provide the factual information required.
[RESULT]: 2
