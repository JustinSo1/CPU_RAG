[PROMPT]: Was Anders Celsius (November 27, 1701 April 25, 1744) a Swedish astronomer?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any relevant information about Anders Celsius's nationality or profession, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about Anders Celsius's nationality or profession. Instead, it states that the context does not provide relevant information, which is not an accurate or factual response to the question. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that Anders Celsius was indeed a Swedish astronomer. The response fails to provide this correct information and is therefore completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
