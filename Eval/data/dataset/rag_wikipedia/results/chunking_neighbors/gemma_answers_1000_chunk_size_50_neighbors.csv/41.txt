[PROMPT]: Was Lincoln chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln was chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Lincoln was chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860. The evaluated response fails to provide this factual information and instead states that the context does not provide the necessary information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer.
[RESULT]: 1
