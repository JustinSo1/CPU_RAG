[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln sign the National Banking Act of 1863?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a clear answer to the question. It states that the knowledge base did not have a match and does not confirm or deny whether Lincoln signed the National Banking Act of 1863. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
