[PROMPT]: Did lincoln have 18 months of schooling?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln had 18 months of schooling, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not answer the question directly and instead states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that Lincoln did have 18 months of schooling. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
