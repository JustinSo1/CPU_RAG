[PROMPT]: What did The Legal Tender Act of 1862 establish?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about what the Legal Tender Act of 1862 established, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about what the Legal Tender Act of 1862 established. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This does not align with the reference answer, which clearly states that the Act established the United States Note, the first paper currency in United States history. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
