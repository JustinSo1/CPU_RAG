[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln win the election of 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Lincoln won the election of 1860. Instead, it provides an irrelevant statement about the knowledge base. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
