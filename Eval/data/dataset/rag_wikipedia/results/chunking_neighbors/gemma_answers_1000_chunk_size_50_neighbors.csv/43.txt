[PROMPT]: When did he publish a collection?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about when Theodore Roosevelt published a collection of his writings, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1733
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct year "1733" as indicated in the reference answer. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information, which is not aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
