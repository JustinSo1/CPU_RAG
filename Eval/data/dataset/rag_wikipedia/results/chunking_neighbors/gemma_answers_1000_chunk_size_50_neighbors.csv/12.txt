[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln ever represent Alton & Sangamon Railroad?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lincoln representing the Alton & Sangamon Railroad, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not aligned with the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that Lincoln did represent the Alton & Sangamon Railroad. Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
