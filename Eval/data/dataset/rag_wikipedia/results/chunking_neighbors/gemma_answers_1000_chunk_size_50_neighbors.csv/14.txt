[PROMPT]: When did the Gettysburg address argue that America was born?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the Gettysburg address arguing that America was born, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1776
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. The Gettysburg Address explicitly states that America was born in 1776, which is a factual and accurate detail. The response fails to address this and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the question asked. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
