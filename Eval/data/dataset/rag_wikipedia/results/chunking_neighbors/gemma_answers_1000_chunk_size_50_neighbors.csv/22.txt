[PROMPT]: How old was Lincoln in 1816?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lincoln's age in 1816, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: seven
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The question asks for Lincoln's age in 1816, which is a factual question that can be answered with the information that Abraham Lincoln was born in 1809. Therefore, he would have been seven years old in 1816. The response does not provide this information and instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
