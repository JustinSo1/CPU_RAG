[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the thermometer's freezing point, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that the freezing point is 100, while the response claims that there is no information provided to answer the question. This shows a lack of understanding or misinterpretation of the question.
[RESULT]: 1
