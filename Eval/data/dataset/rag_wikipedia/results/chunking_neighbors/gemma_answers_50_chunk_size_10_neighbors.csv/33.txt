[PROMPT]: Was Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro an Italian savant?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro was an Italian savant. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes

Instead, it states that the context does not provide information to answer the question, which is not relevant to the task. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Avogadro was indeed an Italian savant. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
