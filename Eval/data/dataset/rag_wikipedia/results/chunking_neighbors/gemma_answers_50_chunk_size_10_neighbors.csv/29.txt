[PROMPT]: Who graduated in ecclesiastical law at the early age of 20 and began to practice?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about who graduated in ecclesiastical law at the early age of 20 and began to practice, hence I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Amedeo Avogadro
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. It states that the context does not provide the information, which is not accurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly identifies Amedeo Avogadro as the person who graduated in ecclesiastical law at the early age of 20 and began to practice. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate.
[RESULT]: 1
