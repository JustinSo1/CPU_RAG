[PROMPT]: Did Abraham Lincoln live in the Frontier?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Abraham Lincoln lived in the Frontier, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the task. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Abraham Lincoln did live in the Frontier. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
