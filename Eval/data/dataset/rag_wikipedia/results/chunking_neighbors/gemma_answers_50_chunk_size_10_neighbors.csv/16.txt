[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln win the election of 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context provides that Lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the United States in 1860 and was re-elected by a majority vote in the same year. Therefore, Lincoln won the election of 1860.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual in stating that Lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the United States in 1860. However, it inaccurately mentions that Lincoln was re-elected by a majority vote in the same year, which is incorrect as he was re-elected in 1864. This inaccuracy affects the overall correctness of the response.
