[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln's Wife's Family support slavery?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the Lincoln's wife's family's support for slavery, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about Lincoln's wife's family's support for slavery. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not aligned with the reference answer "Yes." Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
