[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln start his political career in 1832?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context provides that Lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age seven.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. While it correctly identifies the year 1832, it inaccurately states that Lincoln began his political career at age seven, which is factually incorrect. Lincoln was born in 1809, making him 23 years old in 1832, not seven. This significant inaccuracy affects the overall correctness and factuality of the response.
[RESULT]: 2
