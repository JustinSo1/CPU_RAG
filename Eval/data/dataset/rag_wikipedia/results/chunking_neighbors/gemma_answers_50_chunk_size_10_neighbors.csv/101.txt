[PROMPT]: Is he most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about which is most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the person in question is indeed noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight. The evaluated response, however, states that there is no information provided to answer the question, which contradicts the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate.
[RESULT]: 1
