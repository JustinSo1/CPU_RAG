[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The question asks for a factual answer about the 1860 election, and the reference answer clearly states "yes." The response, however, states that there is no information provided to answer the question, which is not accurate. The response does not address the factual aspect of the question directly and instead deflects by mentioning the lack of context.
[RESULT]: 2
