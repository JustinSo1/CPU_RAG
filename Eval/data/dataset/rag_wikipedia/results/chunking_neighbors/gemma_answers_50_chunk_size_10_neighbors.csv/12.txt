[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln ever represent Alton & Sangamon Railroad?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln ever represented Alton & Sangamon Railroad. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Lincoln did represent Alton & Sangamon Railroad. The evaluated response fails to provide this information and instead states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
