[PROMPT]: Did his mother die of pneumonia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Wilson's mother died of pneumonia, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response indicates that the context does not provide information about whether Wilson's mother died of pneumonia, which is not directly answering the question. The reference answer is a simple "no," which is a direct and factual response. The evaluated response, while accurate in stating the lack of context, does not provide the definitive answer required by the question. Therefore, it is not completely correct or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
