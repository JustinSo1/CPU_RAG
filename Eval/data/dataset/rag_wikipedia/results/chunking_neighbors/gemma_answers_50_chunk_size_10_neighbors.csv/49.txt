[PROMPT]: Who was the first to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at the definition of an international temperature scale on scientific grounds ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about who performed and published the first careful experiments aiming at defining an international temperature scale on scientific grounds, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Anders Celsius
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer, which is "Anders Celsius." Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
