[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed translation of the title of the famous 1811 paper, which is not required by the instruction. The instruction only asks if the title can be roughly translated into English, to which the reference answer simply responds "yes." While the translation provided in the response is accurate, the additional information is unnecessary and deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual, but not completely aligned with the instruction's requirement.
[RESULT]: 4
