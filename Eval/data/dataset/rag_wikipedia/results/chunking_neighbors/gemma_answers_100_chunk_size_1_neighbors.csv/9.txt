[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a direct answer to the question asked. Instead, it states an inability to find a match in the knowledge base and does not address whether Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
