[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln's Wife's Family support slavery?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln's wife's family supported slavery, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that Lincoln's wife's family did support slavery. The evaluated response fails to provide this information and is therefore completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
