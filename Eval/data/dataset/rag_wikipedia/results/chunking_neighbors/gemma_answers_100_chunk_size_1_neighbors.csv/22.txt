[PROMPT]: How old was Lincoln in 1816?
[USER_ANSWER]: In 1816, Lincoln was 10 years old. The context does not provide any other information about his age in that year.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: seven
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer indicates that Lincoln was seven years old in 1816, while the response states that he was 10 years old. This discrepancy shows that the response does not align with the factual information provided in the reference answer. Additionally, the statement "The context does not provide any other information about his age in that year" is irrelevant and does not contribute to the accuracy of the response.
[RESULT]: 2
