[PROMPT]: Is Avogadro 's number commonly used to compute the results of chemical reactions ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Avogadro's number is commonly used to compute the results of chemical reactions, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and instead comments on the lack of context, which is not relevant to the instruction. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that Avogadro's number is indeed commonly used to compute the results of chemical reactions. The evaluated response fails to provide this information and is therefore completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
