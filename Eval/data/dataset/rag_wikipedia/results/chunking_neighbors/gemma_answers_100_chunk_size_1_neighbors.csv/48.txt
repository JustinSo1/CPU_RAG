[PROMPT]: Is The Celsius crater on the Moon named after him?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the name Celsius and whether the Celsius crater on the Moon is named after him, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead states that the context does not provide enough information. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that the Celsius crater on the Moon is named after him. Therefore, the response is not accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
