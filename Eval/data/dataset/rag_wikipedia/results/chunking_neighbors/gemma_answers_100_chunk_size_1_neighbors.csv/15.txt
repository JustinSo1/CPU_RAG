[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: John Wilkes Booth
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question "Who assassinated Lincoln?" The correct answer is "John Wilkes Booth," but the response fails to mention this and instead states that it couldn't find a good match in its knowledge base. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
