[PROMPT]: Did Abraham Lincoln live in the Frontier?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Abraham Lincoln living in the Frontier, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Abraham Lincoln did live in the Frontier. The evaluated response, however, claims that there is no information provided to answer the question, which is not accurate. Therefore, the response does not align with the factual information given in the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
