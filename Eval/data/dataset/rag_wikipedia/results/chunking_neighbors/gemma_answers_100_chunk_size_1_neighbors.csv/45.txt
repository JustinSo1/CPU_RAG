[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and does not provide any factual information regarding the freezing point on a thermometer. It fails to confirm or deny the statement about the freezing point being 100, which is incorrect as the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
