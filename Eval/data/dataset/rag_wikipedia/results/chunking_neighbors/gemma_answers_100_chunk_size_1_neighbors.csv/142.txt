[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a clear answer to the question asked. Instead, it states an inability to find a match in the knowledge base and relies on the responder's own knowledge without providing a definitive answer. This does not align with the reference answer, which is a clear "No." Therefore, the response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
