[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln ever represent Alton & Sangamon Railroad?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a correct, accurate, or factual answer to the question. Instead, it states an inability to find a match in the knowledge base and does not address whether Lincoln represented Alton & Sangamon Railroad. This does not align with the reference answer, which is a simple "Yes."
[RESULT]: 1
