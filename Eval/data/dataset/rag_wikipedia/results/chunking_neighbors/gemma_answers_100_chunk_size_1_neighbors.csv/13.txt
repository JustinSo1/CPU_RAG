[PROMPT]: Which county was Lincoln born in?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context specifies that Lincoln was born in Hardin County, Kentucky.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Hardin County
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies Hardin County as the place where Lincoln was born, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it includes additional information ("The context specifies that" and "Kentucky") that is not necessary for the answer. While this extra information is accurate, it is not required to answer the question directly.
[RESULT]: 4
