[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly address the question asked. Instead of providing a factual answer, it states an inability to find a match in the knowledge base and relies on the responder's own knowledge without providing a clear answer. This makes the response inaccurate and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "No."
[RESULT]: 1
