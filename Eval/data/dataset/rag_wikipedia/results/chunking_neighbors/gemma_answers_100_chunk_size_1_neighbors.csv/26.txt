[PROMPT]: Did Abraham Lincoln live in the Frontier?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Abraham Lincoln living in the Frontier, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Abraham Lincoln lived in the Frontier. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the fact being asked. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Lincoln did live in the Frontier. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
