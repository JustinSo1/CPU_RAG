[PROMPT]: What happened in 1833?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Avogadro had been recalled to Turin university
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about the event that occurred in 1833. It merely states that the knowledge base did not have a match and does not attempt to answer the question based on the responder's own knowledge. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual in relation to the reference answer provided.
[RESULT]: 1
