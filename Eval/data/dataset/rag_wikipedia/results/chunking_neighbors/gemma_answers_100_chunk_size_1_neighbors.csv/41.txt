[PROMPT]: Was Lincoln chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln was chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual. The question asks whether Lincoln was chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860, and the correct answer is "Yes." The response fails to provide this information and instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is irrelevant to the accuracy of the answer itself.
[RESULT]: 1
