[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln's Wife's Family support slavery?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln's wife's family supported slavery, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.

Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not aligned with the reference answer "Yes." Therefore, the response is completely incorrect based on the reference answer.
