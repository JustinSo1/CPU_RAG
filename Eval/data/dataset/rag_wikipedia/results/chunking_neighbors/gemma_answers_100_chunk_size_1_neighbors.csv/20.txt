[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln start his political career in 1832?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that Lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It confirms that Lincoln began his political career in 1832, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional detail about Lincoln's age (23) is not necessary and slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer. This extra information does not make the response incorrect, but it does make it less concise than the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
