[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln win the election of 1860?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the outcome of the 1860 presidential election, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Lincoln won the election of 1860. Instead, it mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should be straightforward and factual. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
