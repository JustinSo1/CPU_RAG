[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and does not provide a correct, accurate, or factual answer. The question asks about the freezing point on a thermometer, which is 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit, not 100. The response fails to provide this information and instead mentions the inability to find a match in the knowledge base, which is irrelevant to the question.
[RESULT]: 1
