[PROMPT]: Did the scientific community not reserve great attention to his theory ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context does not provide any information about whether the scientific community did not reserve great attention to Avogadro's hypothesis, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the scientific community did not reserve great attention to the theory. The response, however, states that there is no information provided to answer the question, which contradicts the reference answer. Therefore, the response does not align with the reference answer and fails to provide the correct information.
[RESULT]: 2
