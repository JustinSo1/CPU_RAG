[PROMPT]: What is also the distance that Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins?
[USER_ANSWER]: Antarctic tourists are generally advised to keep a distance of at least 5 meters (about 16 feet) from penguins to minimize disturbance to the animals. This guideline helps ensure the safety and well-being of both the wildlife and the visitors. Tour operators and guides in Antarctica often emphasize the importance of maintaining this distance and following other responsible wildlife viewing practices.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 3 meters
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The correct distance Antarctic tourists are told to keep from penguins is 3 meters, while the response states 5 meters. Although the response provides additional context about the importance of maintaining distance and responsible wildlife viewing practices, the key factual detail about the distance is incorrect.
[RESULT]: 2
