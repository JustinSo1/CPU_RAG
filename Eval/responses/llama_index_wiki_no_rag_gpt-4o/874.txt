[PROMPT]: What religions are found in Uruguay?
[USER_ANSWER]: Uruguay is known for its religious diversity and secularism. The predominant religion is Christianity, with the majority of Christians being Roman Catholics. There is also a significant number of Protestants, including various denominations such as Methodists, Anglicans, Baptists, and Pentecostals.

Apart from Christianity, there are smaller communities of other religions, including Judaism, which has a notable presence, especially in Montevideo. There are also adherents of Islam, predominantly among the immigrant communities.

Additionally, there are individuals who practice Afro-Brazilian religions like Umbanda and Candombl√©, which have roots in African spiritual traditions and have been syncretized with elements of Catholicism and Indigenous beliefs.

It is also worth noting that Uruguay has a high percentage of people who identify as non-religious, agnostic, or atheist, which is reflective of the country's strong secularism. The Uruguayan constitution guarantees freedom of religion and the separation of church and state, contributing to the diverse religious landscape.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Roman Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and nonprofessing.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately identifies Christianity (Roman Catholic and Protestant), Judaism, and the presence of non-religious individuals, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it includes additional details about specific Protestant denominations, Islam, Afro-Brazilian religions, and the secular nature of Uruguay, which, while informative, are not necessary based on the reference answer. The core religions mentioned in the reference answer are covered, but the extra information, while not incorrect, is beyond the scope of the reference answer.
