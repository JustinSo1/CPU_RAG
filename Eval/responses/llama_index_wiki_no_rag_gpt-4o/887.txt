[PROMPT]: Is it widely considered the most secular nation in Latin America ?
[USER_ANSWER]: As of the latest information up to October 2023, Uruguay is widely considered the most secular nation in Latin America. This characterization is based on various factors such as the high level of separation between church and state, low levels of religious affiliation and participation, and progressive social policies that reflect secular values. Uruguay has a history of secularism dating back to the early 20th century, with significant legal and cultural shifts that have reduced the influence of religious institutions in public life.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about Uruguay's secularism, including the separation of church and state, low levels of religious affiliation, and progressive social policies. However, the reference answer is a simple "Yes," which suggests that a brief confirmation would have sufficed. The response, while informative, goes beyond what was necessary to answer the question directly. Therefore, it does not align perfectly with the reference answer's simplicity.
[RESULT]: 4
