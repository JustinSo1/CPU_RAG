[PROMPT]: What is "tobogganing"?
[USER_ANSWER]: Tobogganing is a winter activity that involves riding down a snow-covered slope on a toboggan, which is a simple sled traditionally made of a flat piece of wood that curves up at the front. Toboggans can also be made from other materials such as plastic or metal. This activity is popular in regions with significant snowfall and is enjoyed by people of all ages. Tobogganing can be done on designated hills or any suitable snowy incline, and it is often considered a fun and exhilarating way to enjoy the winter season.
