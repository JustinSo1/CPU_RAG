[PROMPT]: What did Coolidge do after graduating from Amherst?
[USER_ANSWER]: After graduating from Amherst College in 1895, Calvin Coolidge moved to Northampton, Massachusetts, where he began studying law. Instead of attending a formal law school, he chose to apprentice at a local law firm, Hammond & Field. In 1897, he was admitted to the bar and started his own law practice in Northampton. This marked the beginning of his career in law and public service, which eventually led him into politics and ultimately to the presidency of the United States.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Coolidge moved to Northampton, MassachuS08_setts
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately states that Coolidge moved to Northampton, Massachusetts, after graduating from Amherst College and began studying law. The additional details about his apprenticeship at Hammond & Field, his admission to the bar in 1897, and the start of his own law practice are factual and provide a comprehensive overview of his early career. However, the reference answer is very brief and does not include these details, so while the response is accurate, it goes beyond the scope of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
