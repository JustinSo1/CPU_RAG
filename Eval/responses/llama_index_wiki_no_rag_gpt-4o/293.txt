[PROMPT]: Do wolf pups tend to have darker fur than adults?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, wolf pups often have darker fur compared to adults. As they grow older, their fur color can lighten or change, depending on the species and individual genetic factors. This darker fur in wolf pups may provide better camouflage and protection during their early, more vulnerable stages of life.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that wolf pups often have darker fur compared to adults and provides additional context about the potential reasons for this color difference. However, the reference answer is very concise and only confirms the fact without additional details. While the extra information in the response is accurate, it is not necessary to meet the criteria of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
