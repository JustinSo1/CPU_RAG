[PROMPT]: When did he drop John from his name?
[USER_ANSWER]: It would help to know who "he" is in order to provide an accurate answer. Could you please provide more context or the full name of the person you're referring to?
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: upon graduating from college
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide an answer to the question "When did he drop John from his name?" Instead, it asks for more context or the full name of the person being referred to. This does not align with the reference answer, which directly states "upon graduating from college." Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not meet the criteria for accuracy or factuality based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
