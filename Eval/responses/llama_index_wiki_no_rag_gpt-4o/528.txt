[CORRECT_ANSWER]: October 1921.
[FEEDBACK]: The response "Liechtenstein's current constitution was adopted on October 5, 1921" is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides the specific date of adoption, which is more detailed than the reference answer. However, the reference answer only specifies the month and year, which is sufficient for a complete answer. The additional detail does not detract from the accuracy but is not necessary for full correctness based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
