[PROMPT]: Was it a two-sentence description that completely caught the essence of Ulysses S. Grant ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Ulysses S. Grant was the 18th President of the United States and a commanding general during the Civil War who led the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy. His presidency was marked by efforts to stabilize the post-war nation and support Reconstruction, though it was also marred by instances of corruption and economic turmoil.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately describes Ulysses S. Grant as the 18th President of the United States and a commanding general during the Civil War who led the Union Army to victory. It also correctly mentions his efforts to stabilize the post-war nation and support Reconstruction, as well as the corruption and economic turmoil during his presidency. However, the response is slightly more detailed than necessary for a two-sentence description, which slightly deviates from the essence of the task.
[RESULT]: 4
