[PROMPT]: According to Reader's Digest, is Finland best for living?
[USER_ANSWER]: As of my last update in October 2023, Finland is often highly rated in various quality of life indices and reports, including those featured in publications like Reader's Digest. Finland is frequently praised for its high standard of living, excellent education system, comprehensive social welfare programs, low levels of corruption, and overall happiness of its citizens. 

For the most current and specific evaluations, including those from Reader's Digest, you would need to refer to the latest issues or their official website as rankings and opinions can vary over time based on new data and changing global conditions.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate description of Finland's high ratings in various quality of life indices, which aligns with the general sentiment that Finland is a great place to live. However, it does not directly answer the specific question about Reader's Digest's evaluation of Finland. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating a direct and clear response was expected. While the response is mostly correct and factual, it lacks the directness and specificity required to fully match the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
