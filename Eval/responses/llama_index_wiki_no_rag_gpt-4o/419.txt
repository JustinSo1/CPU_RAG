[PROMPT]: Was Adams an opponent of the Stamp Act?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, John Adams was an opponent of the Stamp Act. The Stamp Act of 1765 was a British law that imposed a tax on printed materials in the American colonies. John Adams, who later became the second President of the United States, was a vocal critic of the Act. He saw it as an infringement on the rights of the colonists and a violation of the principle of "no taxation without representation." Adams wrote essays and gave speeches condemning the Act and was actively involved in the resistance against it, contributing to the broader movement that ultimately led to the American Revolution.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about John Adams' opposition to the Stamp Act, including his actions and the reasons behind his stance. This additional context, while more detailed than the reference answer, does not detract from the accuracy and correctness of the response.
[RESULT]: 5
