[PROMPT]: Do penguins have a better than average sense of hearing for birds?
[USER_ANSWER]: Penguins do have a well-developed sense of hearing, which is essential for their survival, particularly for communication and recognizing calls from mates and chicks in noisy colonies. However, it's not generally considered to be significantly better than average compared to other birds. Many bird species have highly specialized and acute hearing abilities adapted to their specific environments and needs.

Penguins' hearing is particularly adapted to their aquatic lifestyle. They can hear well both in air and underwater, which helps them avoid predators, locate prey, and communicate. However, other birds, such as owls, also have extremely advanced hearing adapted to their hunting needs. Therefore, while penguins have good hearing, especially suited to their ecological niches, it's not necessarily superior to that of other birds with specialized hearing adaptations.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about penguins' sense of hearing, mentioning its importance for survival and communication. It accurately states that penguins have well-developed hearing but clarifies that it is not significantly better than average compared to other birds. This aligns with the reference answer, which implies that penguins do not have a better than average sense of hearing. The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual, but it includes additional information that, while informative, is not necessary to answer the question directly.
[RESULT]: 4
