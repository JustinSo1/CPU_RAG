[PROMPT]: Was Wilson , a staunch opponent of antisemitism , sympathetic to the plight of Jews , especially in Poland and in France ?
[USER_ANSWER]: It seems like you may be referring to Woodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States, who served from 1913 to 1921. Wilson's stance on antisemitism and his sympathy toward the plight of Jews, particularly in Poland and France, can be understood in the broader context of his policies and actions during his presidency.

Woodrow Wilson is generally regarded as having progressive views on various social issues for his time. He appointed the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice, Louis Brandeis, in 1916, which indicated a degree of support for Jewish Americans and their rights.

Regarding the situation of Jews in Europe, particularly in Poland and France, Wilson's actions were more indirect. After World War I, Wilson played a significant role in the establishment of the League of Nations and the drafting of the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty included provisions aimed at protecting minority rights in new and reconstituted states, including Poland. These provisions were intended to safeguard the rights of ethnic and religious minorities, including Jews.

While Wilson's direct involvement in the plight of Jews in Poland and France might not be extensively documented, his broader efforts to promote democracy, self-determination, and minority rights reflect a level of sympathy and concern for oppressed groups, including Jewish communities.

In summary, while Woodrow Wilson may not have been a staunch opponent of antisemitism in the way we might understand it today, his policies and actions did demonstrate a level of sympathy and support for Jewish rights and minority protections during his presidency.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate account of Woodrow Wilson's actions and policies that indirectly reflect his stance on antisemitism and his sympathy toward Jews, particularly in Poland and France. It mentions his appointment of Louis Brandeis, his role in the League of Nations, and the Treaty of Versailles, which included provisions for minority rights. However, the response does not directly answer the question with a clear "yes" or "no," which is what the reference answer indicates. While the information provided is mostly correct and factual, it lacks the directness and simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
