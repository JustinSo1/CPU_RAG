[PROMPT]: What expression is part of a conceptual framework for testing computer systems?
[USER_ANSWER]: A key expression that is part of a conceptual framework for testing computer systems is the "V-Model." The V-Model, also known as the Verification and Validation model, outlines a structured approach to software development and testing. It emphasizes the importance of validating each phase of the development lifecycle against the corresponding phase of testing.

The V-Model consists of the following components:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Gathering and defining what the system is supposed to do.
2. **System Design**: Creating the architecture of the system.
3. **High-Level Design**: Defining the modules and their interfaces.
4. **Low-Level Design**: Detailing the internal logic of each module.
5. **Coding**: Writing the actual code.

Each of these development stages has a corresponding testing phase:

1. **Acceptance Testing**: Validating the system against requirements.
2. **System Testing**: Verifying the system's compliance with the specified design.
3. **Integration Testing**: Checking the interactions between integrated modules.
4. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components for correctness.

The V-Model highlights that for every development activity, there is a corresponding testing activity, ensuring a thorough validation and verification process. This model helps ensure that the system is built correctly (verification) and that it meets the user's needs (validation).
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Quacks like a duck
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is detailed and accurate in describing the V-Model, which is indeed a conceptual framework for testing computer systems. However, the reference answer "Quacks like a duck" does not align with the expected technical content. Given the rubric, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual in the context of the instruction, but it does not match the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
