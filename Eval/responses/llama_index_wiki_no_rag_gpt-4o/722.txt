[PROMPT]: How many countries in Europe are bigger than Romania?  
[USER_ANSWER]: As of my latest update, Romania has an area of approximately 238,397 square kilometers. There are 11 countries in Europe that are larger than Romania by land area. These countries are:

1. Russia (part of it is in Europe)
2. Ukraine
3. France
4. Spain
5. Sweden
6. Germany
7. Finland
8. Norway
9. Poland
10. Italy
11. United Kingdom

Note that some of these countries, like Russia and Turkey, have land in both Europe and Asia, but only their European parts are considered when determining their size in Europe.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: eleven
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that there are 11 countries in Europe larger than Romania, which matches the reference answer. However, the response includes additional information about the area of Romania and lists the countries, which, while accurate, is not necessary for the answer. The inclusion of Turkey is also slightly misleading since Turkey is not listed among the 11 countries. Overall, the response is detailed and mostly accurate but includes some extraneous information.
[RESULT]: 4
