[PROMPT]: What did Jefferson call John Adams?
[USER_ANSWER]: Thomas Jefferson referred to John Adams by several terms throughout their long and complex relationship, which included periods of both friendship and political rivalry. In their personal correspondence, Jefferson occasionally used terms of respect and affection, addressing Adams as "Dear Sir" or "My Friend." However, during their political battles, Jefferson and his allies sometimes used more critical language. For instance, in the heated election of 1800, Jefferson's camp accused Adams of being a monarchist, suggesting that he was overly fond of centralized power and British-style governance.

It's important to note that after both men retired from politics, they reconciled and resumed their correspondence, which lasted until their deaths on July 4, 1826. Their letters from this period reflect a renewed mutual respect and a shared reflection on their roles in American history.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The "Colossus of Independence".
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed account of the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, including their personal correspondence and political rivalry. However, it does not directly answer the question of what Jefferson specifically called John Adams. The reference answer, "The Colossus of Independence," is a specific term used by Jefferson, which the response fails to mention. Therefore, while the response is factually accurate in its broader context, it does not directly address the instruction.
[RESULT]: 3
