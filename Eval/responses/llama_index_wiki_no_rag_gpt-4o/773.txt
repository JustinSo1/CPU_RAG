[PROMPT]: Is singapore the 17th wealthiest country in the world in terms of gdp per capita?
[USER_ANSWER]: As of the latest available data, Singapore is often ranked among the top countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita. However, the exact ranking can vary depending on the source and year. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank data, Singapore is typically within the top 10 countries globally in terms of GDP per capita. It is unlikely to be ranked as low as 17th. For the most accurate and up-to-date ranking, you should refer to the latest reports from these organizations.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about Singapore's ranking in terms of GDP per capita, mentioning that it is typically within the top 10 countries globally according to sources like the IMF and World Bank. However, the instruction specifically asks if Singapore is the 17th wealthiest country, to which the reference answer is a simple "No." While the response is mostly accurate and factual, it does not directly address the question with a clear "No," which is what the reference answer indicates. Therefore, it is not completely correct as per the rubric.
[RESULT]: 4
