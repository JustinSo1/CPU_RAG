It correctly states that the Celsius crater on the Moon is named after Anders Celsius and provides additional information about the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and the naming of lunar craters. However, the reference answer is simply "Yes," which is concise and directly answers the question. The additional information, while accurate, is not necessary to meet the criteria of the reference answer.
