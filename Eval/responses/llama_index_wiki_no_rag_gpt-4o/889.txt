[USER_ANSWER]: The type of government where the president fulfills the roles of both head of state and head of government is typically known as a presidential system, which is a form of constitutional democracy.

Examples of countries with a presidential system include the United States, Brazil, and Indonesia. In these systems, the president is both the symbolic representative of the country (head of state) and the leader of the executive branch of government (head of government), responsible for enforcing laws and managing the day-to-day operations of the government.
