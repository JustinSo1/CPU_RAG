[PROMPT]: Was Indonesia named after it became an independent country?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, Indonesia was not named after it became an independent country. The name "Indonesia" was used long before the country gained its independence. The term combines the Greek word "Indos" (meaning India) and the word "nesos" (meaning islands), and it was first used in the mid-19th century to refer to the region comprising the Indian Archipelago. The Indonesian nationalist movement adopted the name in the early 20th century, and it became widely recognized internationally. Indonesia declared its independence from the Netherlands on August 17, 1945, and the name Indonesia was officially used for the new nation.
