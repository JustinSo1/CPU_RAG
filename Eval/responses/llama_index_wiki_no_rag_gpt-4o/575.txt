[PROMPT]: Was Fillmore the first U.S. President born after the death of a former president ?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, Millard Fillmore was not the first U.S. President born after the death of a former president. Martin Van Buren holds that distinction. Martin Van Buren, the 8th President of the United States, was born on December 5, 1782, after the death of George Washington. George Washington, the first President, died on December 14, 1799. Therefore, Van Buren was born after a former U.S. President had already died, making him the first president with this distinction. Millard Fillmore, the 13th President, was born on January 7, 1800, which was also after George Washington's death, but he was not the first.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer clearly states "yes," indicating that Fillmore was the first U.S. President born after the death of a former president. The response incorrectly asserts that Martin Van Buren holds this distinction and provides incorrect dates and information about George Washington's death and the birth dates of Van Buren and Fillmore. This contradicts the reference answer and fails to provide accurate information.
[RESULT]: 1
