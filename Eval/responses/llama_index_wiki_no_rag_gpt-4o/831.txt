[PROMPT]: Was Grant's father-in-law a Democrat?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Ulysses S. Grant's father-in-law, Frederick Dent, was a Democrat. Dent was a slaveholder and a supporter of the Democratic Party, which was the pro-slavery party before and during the Civil War. This political affiliation was in contrast to Grant's own views, especially as he became a leading Union general during the Civil War and later a Republican president who worked to implement Reconstruction policies and support civil rights for freed slaves.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that Ulysses S. Grant's father-in-law, Frederick Dent, was a Democrat. The additional information about Dent being a slaveholder and a supporter of the Democratic Party, as well as the contrast with Grant's views, is accurate but not necessary for the instruction. The response could be more concise to align perfectly with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
