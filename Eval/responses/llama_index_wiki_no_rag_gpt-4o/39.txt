[PROMPT]: Can the title of this famous 1811 paper be roughly translated into english?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, I can help with that. However, I would need to know the title of the paper you are referring to in order to provide an accurate translation. Could you please provide the title of the 1811 paper?
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not directly answering the question. The instruction asks for a rough translation of the title of a famous 1811 paper, but the response instead asks for more information. While it is accurate in stating that the title is needed for translation, it does not provide the translation itself or directly address the instruction. Therefore, it is not completely correct or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
