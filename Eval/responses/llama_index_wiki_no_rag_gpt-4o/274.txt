[PROMPT]: Did they not claim Ford 's pardon was quid pro quo in exchange for Nixon 's resignation ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The idea that President Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon was part of a quid pro quo arrangement in exchange for Nixon's resignation has been a topic of speculation and debate, but there is no definitive evidence to support this claim. 

When Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon on September 8, 1974, he stated that it was to help the nation move past the Watergate scandal and heal. Ford consistently denied that there was any deal or quid pro quo involved. He maintained that the decision was made in the interest of national unity and to prevent the prolonged and divisive legal proceedings that would have followed if Nixon were prosecuted.

While some critics and conspiracy theorists have suggested that there might have been an implicit or explicit agreement between Ford and Nixon, no conclusive proof has ever emerged to substantiate these claims. The matter remains a subject of historical debate and interpretation.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: They did claim Ford's pardon was quid pro quo.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about the speculation and debate surrounding Ford's pardon of Nixon, but it does not directly address the instruction's question. The reference answer clearly states that "they did claim Ford's pardon was quid pro quo," while the response elaborates on the lack of definitive evidence and Ford's denial of any deal. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of providing context but not directly answering the question as the reference answer does. Therefore, it does not fully align with the reference answer's direct and clear statement.
[RESULT]: 3
