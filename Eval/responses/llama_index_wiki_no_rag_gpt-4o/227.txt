[PROMPT]: Today, are there more cell phone subscriptions than people in Finland?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, as of recent data, Finland has more cell phone subscriptions than its population. This phenomenon, known as market saturation, is common in many developed countries where it is typical for individuals to have multiple subscriptions, such as for personal and work use, or additional devices like tablets and smartwatches. Finland is one such country where the number of active mobile subscriptions exceeds the population.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Finland has more cell phone subscriptions than its population, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about market saturation and multiple subscriptions, while informative, is not necessary to answer the question directly. The response could be more concise to match the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
