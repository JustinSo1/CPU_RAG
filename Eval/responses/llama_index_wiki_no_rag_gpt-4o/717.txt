[PROMPT]: Did Romania declare neutrality during World War I?
[USER_ANSWER]: Romania did not initially declare neutrality at the outbreak of World War I. However, it did remain neutral for the first two years of the war. Romania eventually joined the conflict on the side of the Allies (the Entente Powers) in August 1916. This decision was influenced by promises of territorial gains, particularly in Transylvania, which was part of Austria-Hungary at the time. Romania's involvement in the war had significant implications for the Eastern Front and the overall course of the conflict.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate account of Romania's position during World War I. It correctly states that Romania remained neutral for the first two years before joining the Allies in 1916. The additional context about the reasons for Romania's decision and its implications is factual and enhances the response. However, the reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the expected response was a straightforward confirmation of neutrality at some point. While the response is factually correct, it goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
