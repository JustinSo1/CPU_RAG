[PROMPT]: Can turtles take many years to reach breeding age ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, many species of turtles take several years to reach breeding age. The time it takes for a turtle to become sexually mature can vary widely depending on the species. For example, some smaller species of turtles may reach maturity in just a few years, while larger species, such as sea turtles, can take 15 to 50 years to reach breeding age. This delayed maturity, combined with other factors such as habitat loss, predation, and environmental changes, can impact turtle populations and their ability to sustain themselves over time.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about the breeding age of turtles, mentioning the variation among species and the factors affecting their maturity. This additional information, while not present in the reference answer, does not detract from the correctness of the response.
[RESULT]: 5
