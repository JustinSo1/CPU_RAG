[PROMPT]: How did the supporters of Henry Clay feel about Fillmore in 1848?
[USER_ANSWER]: In the 1848 presidential election, supporters of Henry Clay had mixed feelings about Millard Fillmore, who was the vice-presidential candidate on the Whig ticket alongside Zachary Taylor. Henry Clay, a prominent Whig leader and three-time presidential candidate, had a substantial following within the party. 

Some of Clay's supporters were skeptical of both Taylor and Fillmore. They were particularly concerned about Taylor’s lack of political experience and his ambiguous stance on key issues, such as the expansion of slavery into new territories. Fillmore, a more established politician with clearer stances, was seen as a balance to Taylor’s lack of political background. However, Fillmore’s support for the Compromise of 1850, which included measures like the Fugitive Slave Act, later alienated some Northern Whigs and further complicated his standing among Clay's supporters.

Overall, while Fillmore was viewed as a more traditional Whig politician compared to Taylor, the ticket did not fully satisfy the expectations of all Clay supporters, who were looking for more definitive leadership on critical issues.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: they were ok with him
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and nuanced explanation of the feelings of Henry Clay's supporters towards Millard Fillmore in the 1848 presidential election. However, the reference answer is very brief and simply states that they were "ok with him." The response goes beyond this by discussing mixed feelings, skepticism, and specific concerns about both Taylor and Fillmore. While the response is factually accurate and provides context, it does not align perfectly with the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. Therefore, it is mostly correct and accurate but not completely aligned with the reference answer's simplicity.
[RESULT]: 4
