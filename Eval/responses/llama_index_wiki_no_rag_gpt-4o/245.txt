[PROMPT]: What is a country with which Finland is involved in an international conflict?
[USER_ANSWER]: As of my last update in October 2023, Finland is not involved in any international conflicts. Finland is known for its policy of military non-alignment and neutrality. It is a member of the European Union and the United Nations, and it generally promotes peaceful resolutions to conflicts. However, Finland has had historical tensions with Russia, particularly during and after World War II, but these tensions have not escalated into an active conflict in recent years. Please verify with the most current sources as the situation could change.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Finland is not involved in international conflicts or border disputes. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately states that Finland is not involved in any international conflicts as of the last update in October 2023, which aligns with the reference answer. The additional information about Finland's policy of military non-alignment, neutrality, and historical tensions with Russia is accurate but not necessary for the answer. The response also appropriately advises verifying with the most current sources, which is a good practice but not required for the answer. Overall, the response is detailed and mostly correct, but the extra information slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
