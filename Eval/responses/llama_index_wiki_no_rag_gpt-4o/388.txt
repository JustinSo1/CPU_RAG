[PROMPT]: In which years were John Monroe elected as President?
[USER_ANSWER]: As of my last update in October 2023, John Monroe has never been elected as President of the United States. It is possible that you are referring to James Monroe, who was the fifth President of the United States. James Monroe was elected in 1816 and re-elected in 1820. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1817-1825
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that John Monroe was never elected as President and suggests that the user might be referring to James Monroe. It accurately states the years James Monroe was elected (1816 and 1820), which aligns with the reference answer's timeframe (1817-1825). However, the response includes additional information and context that, while helpful, is not strictly necessary for answering the question directly. The core information provided is accurate and factual.
[RESULT]: 4
