[PROMPT]: Was Another primary objective of Fillmore to preserve the Union from the intensifying slavery debate?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, one of President Millard Fillmore's primary objectives was to preserve the Union amidst the intensifying debate over slavery. Fillmore, who became the 13th President of the United States after the death of President Zachary Taylor in 1850, faced significant sectional tensions between the North and South. 

To address these issues and maintain the Union, Fillmore supported the Compromise of 1850, a series of legislative measures aimed at easing the sectional conflict. The Compromise included provisions such as the admission of California as a free state, the establishment of territorial governments in the remaining lands acquired from Mexico (with the question of slavery to be decided by popular sovereignty), the abolition of the slave trade in Washington D.C., and the implementation of a stricter Fugitive Slave Law.

Although the Compromise of 1850 had mixed results and ultimately did not resolve the underlying issues, Fillmore's support for it was motivated by his desire to prevent the Union from fracturing and to find a temporary solution to the heated disputes over slavery.
