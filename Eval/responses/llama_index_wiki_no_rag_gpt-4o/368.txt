[PROMPT]: Who has its own political legislature and governor ?
[USER_ANSWER]: A U.S. state has its own political legislature and governor. Each state within the United States operates semi-autonomously under the federal system, meaning they have their own state governments complete with a legislature (typically consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate) and a governor who acts as the executive head.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: each province
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that a U.S. state has its own political legislature and governor, which aligns with the concept of having a semi-autonomous government. However, the reference answer "each province" suggests a broader context that could apply to other countries with provinces, not just U.S. states. The response is specific to the United States, which makes it mostly correct but not completely aligned with the broader context implied by the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
