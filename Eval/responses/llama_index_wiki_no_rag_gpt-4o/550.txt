[PROMPT]: Was the arrival of Louis Kossuth (exiled leader of a failed Hungarian revolution) another issue that presented itself during Fillmore's presidency?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, the arrival of Louis Kossuth in the United States did indeed occur during Millard Fillmore's presidency and presented a notable issue. Kossuth, a leader in the 1848 Hungarian Revolution against the Habsburg monarchy, sought support for the cause of Hungarian independence. He arrived in the United States in December 1851 and was warmly received by many Americans who admired his fight for liberty and self-determination.

However, Kossuth's visit posed a diplomatic challenge for President Fillmore. While there was considerable public enthusiasm for Kossuth and his cause, the U.S. government needed to maintain a delicate balance in its foreign policy. The United States had to be cautious not to appear too interventionist or supportive of revolutionary movements that could strain relations with European powers, particularly the Austrian Empire. Fillmore's administration ultimately decided to maintain a stance of non-intervention, consistent with the longstanding principles outlined in the Monroe Doctrine.

Kossuth's visit highlighted the tension between American ideals of supporting democratic movements abroad and the practical considerations of maintaining diplomatic relationships.
