[PROMPT]: Can polar bears be seen under infrared photography?
[USER_ANSWER]: Polar bears are not easily seen under infrared photography. This is because their thick fur and a layer of blubber provide excellent insulation, which minimizes the amount of body heat that escapes. Infrared cameras detect heat, so animals with higher heat emissions are more visible. Since polar bears are very well insulated to keep warm in cold Arctic environments, they emit very little heat compared to their surroundings, making them difficult to detect with infrared imaging.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Polar bears are nearly invisible under infrared photography.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It explains why polar bears are not easily seen under infrared photography, mentioning their thick fur and blubber as insulation that minimizes heat emission. This aligns with the reference answer, which states that polar bears are nearly invisible under infrared photography. However, the response is more detailed than the reference answer, which is concise and to the point. While the additional details are accurate, they are not necessary to meet the criteria of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
