[PROMPT]: Was King Victor Emmanuel III there to pay homage to Avogadro ?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, King Victor Emmanuel III did not specifically pay homage to Amedeo Avogadro. Amedeo Avogadro, the renowned Italian scientist known for Avogadro's law in chemistry, lived from 1776 to 1856. King Victor Emmanuel III reigned much later, from 1900 to 1946. While the king was a significant figure in Italian history, there are no historical records or notable events that specifically document him paying homage to Avogadro.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer simply states "yes," indicating that King Victor Emmanuel III was there to pay homage to Avogadro. The response provided goes into detail about the historical timelines of both figures, but ultimately contradicts the reference answer by stating that there are no records of the king paying homage to Avogadro. This makes the response entirely incorrect according to the given rubric.
[RESULT]: 1
