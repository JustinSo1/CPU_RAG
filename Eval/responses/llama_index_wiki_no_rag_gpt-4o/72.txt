[PROMPT]: Is it possible that there are more than 350,000 species of beetles?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, it is indeed possible that there are more than 350,000 species of beetles. In fact, beetles (order Coleoptera) are one of the most diverse groups of organisms on Earth. Estimates suggest that there are at least 350,000 named species, but the actual number could be much higher. Some entomologists believe the total number of beetle species could be closer to 500,000 or even higher, considering many species have yet to be discovered and described. Beetles occupy a wide range of ecological niches and can be found in almost every habitat, contributing to their extraordinary diversity.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about the diversity of beetle species, including the fact that there are at least 350,000 named species and that the actual number could be much higher. This aligns with the reference answer, which simply confirms the possibility. The response goes beyond the reference answer by providing additional context and information, but it remains entirely accurate and factual.
[RESULT]: 5
