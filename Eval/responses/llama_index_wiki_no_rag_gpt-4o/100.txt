[PROMPT]: Where did Coolidge's grandfather had government offices?
[USER_ANSWER]: Calvin Coolidge's grandfather, Calvin Galusha Coolidge, held various local government positions in the town of Plymouth Notch, Vermont. He served in roles such as a justice of the peace and a member of the Vermont House of Representatives. Plymouth Notch is a small village, and the government offices would have been located within the community's town buildings or in his own home, which often served multiple functions in such small, rural areas during that time period.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Plymouth
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides detailed information about Calvin Coolidge's grandfather's roles and the general location of his government offices. However, it does not directly answer the question with the specific location "Plymouth" as the reference answer does. While the response is mostly correct and factual, it includes additional details that are not necessary and does not succinctly provide the exact answer required. Therefore, it is not completely correct and accurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
