[PROMPT]: How are Isabelline penguins different from most penguins?
[USER_ANSWER]: Isabelline penguins are quite rare and are distinguished by their unique coloration. Unlike the typical black and white plumage seen in most penguin species, Isabelline penguins have a lighter, brownish or creamy coloration. This unusual coloring is a result of a genetic mutation known as leucism, which causes a partial loss of pigmentation. This mutation affects the melanin in their feathers, giving them a pale appearance rather than the standard stark black and white. Despite their different appearance, Isabelline penguins are otherwise similar to their normally colored counterparts in terms of behavior, diet, and habitat.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: they have brown rather than black plumage
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about the unique coloration of Isabelline penguins, explaining that their lighter, brownish or creamy coloration is due to a genetic mutation known as leucism. This explanation aligns with the reference answer, which states that Isabelline penguins have brown rather than black plumage. However, the response includes additional details about the genetic mutation and the similarities in behavior, diet, and habitat, which, while informative, are not necessary to answer the question directly. The core information about the coloration difference is accurate and factual.
[RESULT]: 4
