[PROMPT]: Had his thermometer 100 for the freezing point of water and 0 for the boiling point ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, the thermometer you are referring to is likely the one invented by the French physicist and engineer Jean-Pierre Christin in the 18th century. This thermometer used an inverted scale compared to the Celsius scale, which is commonly used today. In Christin's scale, 0 degrees corresponded to the boiling point of water, and 100 degrees corresponded to the freezing point of water. This scale, however, did not become widely adopted, and the Celsius scale, where 0 degrees is the freezing point of water and 100 degrees is the boiling point, became the standard.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes it had
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies the thermometer with an inverted scale, where 0 degrees corresponded to the boiling point of water and 100 degrees to the freezing point. However, the reference answer is very brief and to the point, while the response provides additional context and details that, although accurate, are not necessary for the given instruction. The response could be seen as over-explaining, but it does not contain any inaccuracies.
[RESULT]: 4
