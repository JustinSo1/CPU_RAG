[PROMPT]: Is the black color heritable and caused by only one recessive gene locus ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The inheritance of black color can vary significantly depending on the species and the specific trait in question. In some cases, black coloration can be controlled by a single gene locus, but it is not always caused by a recessive gene.

For example, in some animals like certain breeds of dogs, the black coat color can be the result of a dominant gene at a particular locus. In other species, like some plants or insects, black coloration might be controlled by multiple genes and not necessarily follow simple Mendelian inheritance patterns.

In general, the inheritance of color traits can be quite complex, involving multiple genes, interactions between genes, and environmental factors. Therefore, without specifying the organism and the trait, it is hard to generalize about the genetic mechanisms behind black coloration.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is not aligned with the reference answer, which is a simple "Yes." The response elaborates on the complexity of genetic inheritance of black color across different species, which is not directly addressing the question. The question specifically asks if black color is heritable and caused by only one recessive gene locus, and the reference answer confirms this with a straightforward "Yes." The evaluated response introduces variability and complexity that is not required or relevant to the specific question asked. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
