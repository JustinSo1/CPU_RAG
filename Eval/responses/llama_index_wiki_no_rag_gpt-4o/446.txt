[PROMPT]: Is a kangaroo a reptile?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, a kangaroo is not a reptile. A kangaroo is a mammal, specifically a marsupial. Marsupials are a group of mammals that carry and nurse their young in pouches. Kangaroos are native to Australia and are known for their powerful hind legs and large, strong tails that they use for balance and support. Reptiles, on the other hand, are a class of cold-blooded vertebrates that typically lay eggs and have scales or scutes. Examples of reptiles include snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that a kangaroo is not a reptile but a mammal, specifically a marsupial. The additional information about marsupials and reptiles is accurate and provides a clear distinction between the two classes of animals. However, the reference answer is very brief, and the response goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer. Despite this, the response is factually accurate and informative.
[RESULT]: 5
