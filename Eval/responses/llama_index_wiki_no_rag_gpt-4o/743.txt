[PROMPT]: How much increase in the media's contribution to GDP is the government seeking?
[USER_ANSWER]: As of my latest update in October 2023, I don't have access to real-time data or specific government policy changes occurring after that period. However, if the government has recently announced a target for increasing the media industry's contribution to GDP, such details would be available in recent government releases, economic plans, or official statements.

To get the most accurate and current information, I recommend checking the latest reports from the relevant government department, official announcements, or trusted news sources.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The government seeks to increase its GDP contribution to 3% by 2012. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the specific information requested in the instruction. It does not mention the target of increasing the media industry's contribution to GDP to 3% by 2012, which is the key detail in the reference answer. Instead, the response gives a general suggestion on where to find the information, which does not address the question directly. Therefore, it is mostly incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
