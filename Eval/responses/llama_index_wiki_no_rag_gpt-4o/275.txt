[PROMPT]: Does Ghana have twice the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa?
[USER_ANSWER]: As of the latest available data, Ghana is one of the more economically developed countries in West Africa, but it is not accurate to say that it has twice the per capita output of the poorest countries in the region. Countries like Niger, Sierra Leone, and Liberia typically have lower GDP per capita compared to Ghana. However, the difference is not as stark as being twofold in many cases.

For a more precise and current comparison, you would need to refer to the most recent figures from sources such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which provide updated data on GDP per capita for countries worldwide.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about Ghana's economic status in comparison to other West African countries. However, it does not directly answer the question with a simple "yes" or "no" as the reference answer does. The response is mostly correct and factual, but it lacks the directness and simplicity of the reference answer. It also introduces some uncertainty by suggesting the need for the most recent figures, which is not present in the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is informative and mostly accurate, it does not fully align with the reference answer's straightforwardness.
[RESULT]: 4
