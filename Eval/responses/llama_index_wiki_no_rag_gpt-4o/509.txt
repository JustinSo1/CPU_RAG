[PROMPT]: Were the Leopard men a West African secret society who practised cannibalism ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, the Leopard men were indeed a secret society in West Africa, specifically in regions such as Sierra Leone, Liberia, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, and Nigeria. They were known for their ritualistic practices which reportedly included acts of cannibalism. Members of this society were believed to don leopard skins and use claw-like weapons to emulate the attacks of a leopard. The society's activities were often shrouded in secrecy and fear, which contributed to their mystique and notoriety.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about the Leopard men, including their geographical locations, ritualistic practices, and the use of leopard skins and claw-like weapons. However, the reference answer is very brief and only confirms the existence of the Leopard men as a secret society practicing cannibalism. The evaluated response goes beyond the reference answer by adding additional context and details, which, while accurate, are not necessary to meet the criteria of the reference answer. Therefore, it does not align perfectly with the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
