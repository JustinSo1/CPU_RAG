[PROMPT]: Did Fillmore form a law partnership before or after he founded the private University of Buffalo?
[USER_ANSWER]: Millard Fillmore formed a law partnership before he founded the private University of Buffalo. Fillmore established his law practice in the 1820s and formed a partnership with Nathan K. Hall in 1834. He later played a significant role in founding the University of Buffalo (now the University at Buffalo, part of the State University of New York system) in 1846.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Before.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Millard Fillmore formed a law partnership before founding the University of Buffalo. The additional details about the timeline of his law practice and partnership with Nathan K. Hall in 1834, as well as the founding of the University of Buffalo in 1846, are accurate and provide context. However, the reference answer is a simple "Before," which is more concise. The response could be considered overly detailed for the question asked, but it does not detract from the accuracy of the information provided.
[RESULT]: 4
