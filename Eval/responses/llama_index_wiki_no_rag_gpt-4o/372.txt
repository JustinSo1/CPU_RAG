[PROMPT]: Is James Monrow the fifth president of US?
[USER_ANSWER]: It looks like there is a small typo in your question. James Monroe was the fifth president of the United States, not "James Monrow." He served as president from 1817 to 1825.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies James Monroe as the fifth president of the United States and provides additional information about his term in office. However, the response includes extra details about the typo and his term dates, which are not necessary to answer the question directly. The reference answer is more concise and directly addresses the question without additional information.
[RESULT]: 4
