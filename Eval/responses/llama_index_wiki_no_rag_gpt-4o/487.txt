[PROMPT]: What is a hybrid animal resulting from a union between a leopard and a puma?
[USER_ANSWER]: A hybrid animal resulting from the union between a leopard and a puma is often referred to as a "pumapard." Pumapards are rare hybrids that exhibit physical and behavioral traits from both parent species. These hybrids are typically smaller in size than either parent and may have a coat pattern that is a mix of the puma's solid color and the leopard's spots. However, such hybrids are uncommon and not naturally occurring in the wild, as leopards and pumas inhabit different continents and have different ecological niches.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: a pumapard
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies the hybrid animal resulting from the union between a leopard and a puma as a "pumapard." The additional information provided about the rarity, physical traits, and ecological aspects of pumapards is accurate and factual. However, the reference answer is concise and only requires the name "pumapard." While the extra details are informative, they are not necessary for the response to be considered completely correct based on the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 4
