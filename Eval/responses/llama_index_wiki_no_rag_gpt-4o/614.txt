[PROMPT]: Sea otters eat what?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sea otters have a diverse diet that primarily consists of marine invertebrates. Some of their favorite foods include sea urchins, crabs, clams, snails, and various species of shellfish. They are known for their ability to use tools, such as rocks, to break open the hard shells of their prey. Sea otters play a crucial role in maintaining the health of kelp forest ecosystems by keeping the populations of sea urchins and other herbivorous invertebrates in check.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Shellfish and other invertebrates
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed and accurate description of the sea otter's diet, mentioning specific types of marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, crabs, clams, snails, and various species of shellfish. Additionally, it includes extra information about the sea otters' use of tools and their ecological role, which, while informative, goes beyond the scope of the question. The core information about their diet aligns well with the reference answer, but the additional details, while accurate, are not necessary for a perfect score based on the rubric.
[RESULT]: 4
