[PROMPT]: Did Ulysses win the Battle of Champion Hill?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, Ulysses S. Grant did not win the Battle of Champion Hill. The battle was fought on May 16, 1863, during the American Civil War. Ulysses S. Grant, who was a Union general, actually led his forces to victory against the Confederate army commanded by General John C. Pemberton. The Union's victory at Champion Hill was a significant moment in the Vicksburg Campaign, ultimately leading to the Siege of Vicksburg and the Confederates' surrender of the city on July 4, 1863.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The initial statement "No, Ulysses S. Grant did not win the Battle of Champion Hill" is factually incorrect, as the reference answer clearly states "Yes." Although the response provides accurate historical context about the battle and Grant's role, the primary answer to the question is incorrect.
[RESULT]: 2
