[PROMPT]: Is it true that it angered many residents of the thirteen colonies?
[USER_ANSWER]: To provide a more accurate response, I need to know which specific event or action you are referring to. Many events and actions angered the residents of the thirteen colonies leading up to the American Revolution. For instance, the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend Acts of 1767, and the Tea Act of 1773 were all British policies that incited significant anger and resistance among the colonists. These events contributed to the growing discontent that eventually led to the American Revolution. If you can specify the event or policy you have in mind, I can give a more detailed answer.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the context surrounding the anger of the residents of the thirteen colonies, mentioning specific events and policies that contributed to their discontent. However, the instruction only required a simple confirmation ("yes") to the question. While the response is factually correct and accurate, it does not align with the simplicity of the reference answer. Therefore, it is more detailed than necessary for the given instruction.
[RESULT]: 4
