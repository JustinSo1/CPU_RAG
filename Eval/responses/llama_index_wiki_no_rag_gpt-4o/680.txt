[PROMPT]: Did Mitchell Taylor , the Nunavut Government Manager of Wildlife Research , not write a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service arguing that local studies are insufficient evidence for global protection at this time ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Mitchell Taylor, who was a biologist and the Manager of Wildlife Research for the Government of Nunavut, did write a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In his letter, he argued that the local studies and data available at the time were insufficient evidence to warrant listing polar bears under the Endangered Species Act for global protection. Taylor's position was based on his belief that polar bear populations in certain areas were stable or increasing, and he felt this information was not being adequately considered in the broader discussion about the species' status.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is factually accurate and detailed, but it does not directly answer the question as simply and directly as the reference answer does. The reference answer is a straightforward "no," while the response elaborates on the context and details of Mitchell Taylor's actions and arguments. While the additional information is accurate, it does not align with the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct and factual but not completely aligned with the expected answer format.
[RESULT]: 4
