[PROMPT]: Have coleopterists formed organisations to facilitate the study of beetles ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, coleopterists (scientists who study beetles) have formed various organizations to facilitate the study and research of beetles. These organizations often provide a platform for sharing knowledge, promoting research, and fostering collaboration among entomologists. Some of these organizations include:

1. **Coleopterists Society**: An international organization that promotes the study of beetles through publications, meetings, and awards.

2. **Entomological Society of America (ESA)**: While not exclusively for beetles, ESA includes many coleopterists and provides resources, conferences, and publications relevant to beetle research.

3. **Royal Entomological Society**: Based in the UK, this society supports entomological research and includes professionals who specialize in beetles.

4. **European Congress of Coleopterology**: A periodic meeting that brings together coleopterists from Europe and beyond to discuss recent research and developments in the field.

These organizations, among others, play a crucial role in advancing the knowledge and understanding of beetles, supporting professionals and amateurs in their research and conservation efforts.
