[PROMPT]: Were the treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Ukraine?
[USER_ANSWER]: The treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 were not specifically with Ukraine. These years are notable for several significant international treaties, especially in the context of World War II and its aftermath. For example:

1. **1947**: The Paris Peace Treaties were signed on February 10, 1947. These treaties were between the Allied powers and the Axis powers (Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland) to formally end hostilities and establish post-war order. Ukraine, being a part of the Soviet Union at that time, was not an independent signatory to these treaties.

2. **1948**: There were no major treaties specifically involving Ukraine in 1948. However, this year saw the signing of the Treaty of Brussels (also known as the Brussels Pact) on March 17, 1948. This was a treaty between Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom as a collective defense agreement against potential aggression, laying the groundwork for the establishment of NATO. Ukraine was not involved, as it was still part of the Soviet Union.

Ukraine did not independently engage in international treaties until after it declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that the treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 were not specifically with Ukraine, providing detailed context about the Paris Peace Treaties and the Treaty of Brussels. However, the reference answer is a simple "no," which is completely correct and factual. The detailed explanation, while accurate, goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the reference answer's simplicity.
[RESULT]: 4
