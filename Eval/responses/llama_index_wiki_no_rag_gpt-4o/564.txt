[PROMPT]: What did Taylor and Fillmore disagree upon?
[USER_ANSWER]: President Zachary Taylor and Vice President Millard Fillmore held differing views on key political issues during their time in office, particularly regarding the Compromise of 1850. This series of legislative measures aimed to ease the tensions between free and slave states following the acquisition of new territories after the Mexican-American War.

Taylor, a Southern slaveholder, surprisingly opposed the spread of slavery into the newly acquired territories and favored their admission as free states. He believed that the issue of slavery should be decided by the inhabitants of those territories rather than by Congress.

Fillmore, on the other hand, was more inclined to support the Compromise of 1850, which sought to balance the interests of both free and slave states. The Compromise included measures such as admitting California as a free state, establishing territorial governments in the remaining lands acquired from Mexico without restrictions on slavery, and enacting a stricter Fugitive Slave Law.

Their disagreement on these issues underscored the growing sectional tensions within the United States, which would eventually lead to the Civil War. After Taylor's death in 1850, Fillmore succeeded him as President and supported the passage of the Compromise of 1850, which he believed was necessary to preserve the Union.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: slavory issues
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation of the disagreement between Taylor and Fillmore, specifically focusing on their differing views regarding the Compromise of 1850 and the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories. However, the reference answer is very brief and only mentions "slavery issues," which is the core of their disagreement. The evaluated response elaborates on this core issue accurately but includes additional context that, while relevant, is not explicitly required by the reference answer. Therefore, it is mostly correct and factual but slightly more detailed than necessary.
[RESULT]: 4
