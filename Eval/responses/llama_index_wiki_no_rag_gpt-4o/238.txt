[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides detailed information about the cathedrals in Finland, listing several notable ones and their locations. However, it does not directly answer the question of whether cathedrals are scattered all across Finland. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the presence of cathedrals throughout the country. While the response is factually accurate and informative, it does not align with the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. Therefore, it is somewhat correct but not fully aligned with the expected response.
[RESULT]: 3
