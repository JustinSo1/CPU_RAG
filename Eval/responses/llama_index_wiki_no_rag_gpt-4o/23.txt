[PROMPT]: When was the first photgraph of lincoln taken?
[USER_ANSWER]: The first photograph of Abraham Lincoln was taken in 1846 or 1847 by Nicholas H. Shepherd. At that time, Lincoln was a young lawyer and congressman-elect. This daguerreotype shows Lincoln without his iconic beard, looking quite different from the familiar images of him later in life.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1846
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides the correct information that the first photograph of Abraham Lincoln was taken in 1846 or 1847, which aligns with the reference answer of 1846. However, the inclusion of the year 1847 introduces a slight inaccuracy. The additional context about the photographer and Lincoln's appearance is accurate but not necessary for the answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual, but not completely precise due to the mention of 1847.
[RESULT]: 4
