[PROMPT]: What have been inhabited for millennia by aboriginal peoples?
[USER_ANSWER]: Regions such as Australia, parts of North America and South America, and various areas in Africa and Asia have been inhabited for millennia by aboriginal peoples. These indigenous communities have rich cultures and histories that date back thousands of years, long before the arrival of European settlers and other colonial powers. Aboriginal Australians, Native American tribes, the First Nations of Canada, the MƒÅori of New Zealand, and many other groups around the world are examples of these ancient populations.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The lands
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides specific examples of regions and groups that have been inhabited by aboriginal peoples for millennia, which aligns with the reference answer indicating "The lands." However, the response includes additional details that, while informative, are not necessary to answer the question directly. The core idea is conveyed accurately, but the extra information slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
