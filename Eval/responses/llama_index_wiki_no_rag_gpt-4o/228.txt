[PROMPT]: Is Matti Vanhanen the Prime Minister of Finland?
[USER_ANSWER]: As of my last update in October 2023, Matti Vanhanen is not the Prime Minister of Finland. The current Prime Minister is Petteri Orpo, who took office on June 20, 2023. Matti Vanhanen previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2010. For the most current information, please check the latest updates from reliable sources.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Matti Vanhanen is not the current Prime Minister of Finland and provides accurate information about the current Prime Minister, Petteri Orpo, and his term start date. However, the reference answer is simply "yes," which implies that the response should have been a straightforward confirmation. The additional details, while accurate, deviate from the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
