[PROMPT]: Was Wilson a remarkably effective writer and thinker?
[USER_ANSWER]: If you are referring to Woodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States, then yes, he was considered a remarkably effective writer and thinker. Before his presidency, Wilson was an accomplished academic, serving as a professor and later as the president of Princeton University. His scholarly work, particularly in political science, was highly regarded.

Wilson's writing was influential in shaping public policy and opinion. His books and essays on government and politics were widely read and respected. As a thinker, his ideas about the role of government and international relations had a significant impact, most notably through his advocacy for the League of Nations following World War I.

If you are referring to a different Wilson, please provide more context so I can give a more specific answer.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about Woodrow Wilson's background, his academic achievements, and his influence as a writer and thinker. However, the reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that a brief and direct response would have been sufficient. The additional context provided in the response, while accurate, goes beyond what was necessary to answer the question directly. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
