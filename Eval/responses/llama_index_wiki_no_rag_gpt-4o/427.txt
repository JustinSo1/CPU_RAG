[PROMPT]: Did John Adams support the Stamp Act of 1765?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, John Adams did not support the Stamp Act of 1765. In fact, he was a vocal opponent of the Act. The Stamp Act was a piece of British legislation that imposed a direct tax on the colonies by requiring that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp. This act was seen as a way for Britain to recoup some of the costs of defending the American colonies during the French and Indian War.

John Adams, like many other colonists, viewed the Stamp Act as an infringement on their rights. He believed that it was unfair for the colonies to be taxed by the British Parliament, in which they had no representationâ€”a sentiment encapsulated in the popular slogan, "No taxation without representation." Adams expressed his opposition through writings and speeches, and he became an important figure in the resistance against British policies, which ultimately contributed to the broader movement for American independence.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
