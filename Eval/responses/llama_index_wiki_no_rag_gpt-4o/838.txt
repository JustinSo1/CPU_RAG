[PROMPT]: Why did Grant think that war was unjust?
[USER_ANSWER]: Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States and a commanding general during the Civil War, had complex views on the nature of war. While he is known for his military leadership, his personal reflections reveal a deep understanding of the human cost and moral complexities of conflict. 

Grant is often quoted from his memoirs indicating his belief that war is inherently destructive and should be avoided if possible. In "Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant," he wrote about the immense suffering caused by war and expressed a hope that future generations would resolve their differences without resorting to violence. He saw war as a necessary evil in certain circumstances, such as the Civil War, which he viewed as essential to preserving the Union and ending slavery. However, he recognized the devastation and loss that war brings, suggesting that it is an unjust means of resolving disputes whenever it can be avoided.

His experiences in the Civil War, observing firsthand the death, destruction, and suffering, likely reinforced his belief in the unjust nature of war, despite his role as a successful military leader. Grant's nuanced perspective reflects a deep moral contemplation on the consequences of war and the importance of striving for peaceful resolutions.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: He thought it was designed to gain land open to slavery.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and nuanced view of Ulysses S. Grant's perspective on war, highlighting his recognition of the human cost and moral complexities. However, it does not directly address the specific reason mentioned in the reference answer, which is that Grant thought war was designed to gain land open to slavery. While the response is factually accurate and well-articulated, it does not align closely with the reference answer's specific point. Therefore, it is somewhat correct and accurate but misses the main reason provided in the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
