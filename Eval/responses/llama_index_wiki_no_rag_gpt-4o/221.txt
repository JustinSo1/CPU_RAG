[PROMPT]: Is the most read newspaper in Finland Taloussanomat?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, the most read newspaper in Finland is not Taloussanomat. The most read newspaper in Finland is Helsingin Sanomat, which is a major daily newspaper based in Helsinki. It has a broad readership and covers a wide range of topics including news, politics, culture, and more. Taloussanomat, on the other hand, is a newspaper that focuses primarily on business and economic news.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that Taloussanomat is not the most read newspaper in Finland and provides additional information about Helsingin Sanomat being the most read newspaper. However, the reference answer is very brief and only states "no," which is a complete and factual response to the question. The additional details in the evaluated response, while accurate, are not necessary to meet the criteria of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
