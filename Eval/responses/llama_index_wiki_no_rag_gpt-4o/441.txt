[PROMPT]: Are his last words often quoted as " Thomas Jefferson survives " . ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, it is often reported that the last words of John Adams, the second President of the United States, were "Thomas Jefferson survives." Adams and Jefferson, both founding fathers and former presidents, had a notable rivalry and later a deep friendship. Interestingly, both of them died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. However, it's worth noting that by the time Adams uttered these words, Thomas Jefferson had already passed away a few hours earlier, though Adams was unaware of this fact.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that John Adams' last words are often quoted as "Thomas Jefferson survives." The additional context about Adams and Jefferson's relationship and their deaths on the same day is accurate and relevant. However, the reference answer is simply "yes," indicating that a brief confirmation was sufficient. The response, while informative, goes beyond what was necessary and expected based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
