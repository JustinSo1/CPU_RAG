[PROMPT]: What do river otters eat?
[USER_ANSWER]: River otters are carnivorous mammals that have a varied diet primarily consisting of aquatic organisms. They predominantly eat fish, but their diet also commonly includes amphibians (such as frogs and salamanders), crustaceans (such as crayfish and crabs), and small mammals. Occasionally, river otters may also consume birds, reptiles, insects, and even small amounts of plant material. Their opportunistic feeding habits allow them to adapt to the availability of different food sources in their habitat.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: a variety of fish and shellfish, as well as small land mammals and birds
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed and comprehensive list of what river otters eat, including fish, amphibians, crustaceans, small mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, and even small amounts of plant material. However, it goes beyond the reference answer by including additional details that, while accurate, are not necessary for a perfect score based on the reference answer. The reference answer is more concise and focuses on the primary components of the river otter's diet: fish, shellfish, small land mammals, and birds.
