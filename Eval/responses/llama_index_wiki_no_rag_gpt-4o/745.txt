[PROMPT]: Is Singapore located at the southern tip of the Korean Penisula?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, Singapore is not located at the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula. Singapore is a sovereign city-state and island country in Southeast Asia, situated at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. It is separated from Peninsular Malaysia by the Johor Strait to the north and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to the south. The Korean Peninsula, on the other hand, is located in East Asia and is home to North Korea and South Korea.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation that Singapore is not located at the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, and correctly identifies Singapore's actual location in Southeast Asia. The additional information about the geographical separation from Peninsular Malaysia and Indonesia's Riau Islands, as well as the clarification about the location of the Korean Peninsula, further supports the accuracy of the response. However, the reference answer is very concise, and while the detailed explanation in the response is accurate, it goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer.
