[PROMPT]: Can an elephant kill a rhinoceros?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, an elephant can potentially kill a rhinoceros. Both elephants and rhinoceroses are large, strong, and powerful animals, and conflicts between them can occur, particularly in the wild where they may compete for resources such as food and water. Elephants are generally larger and heavier than rhinoceroses, which can give them an advantage in a physical confrontation. Additionally, elephants have strong tusks that can be used as weapons. However, such encounters are relatively rare, as these animals typically prefer to avoid conflict when possible.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation that supports the idea that an elephant can kill a rhinoceros, mentioning the size and strength of both animals, the potential for conflict over resources, and the use of tusks as weapons. However, the reference answer is very brief and simply states "yes," which is completely correct and factual. The detailed response, while accurate, goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
