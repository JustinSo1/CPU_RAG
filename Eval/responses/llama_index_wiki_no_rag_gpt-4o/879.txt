[PROMPT]: What has many possible meanings?
[USER_ANSWER]: The term "ambiguity" refers to something that has many possible meanings. Ambiguity occurs when information can be interpreted in several ways, leading to uncertainty or multiple interpretations. This can apply to language, symbols, situations, or even entire concepts that aren't clearly defined.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: (What?)
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is accurate in defining "ambiguity" as something that has many possible meanings. However, the reference answer "What?" suggests that the expected response should be more open-ended or questioning rather than a detailed explanation. While the response is factually correct, it does not align with the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. Therefore, it is not completely correct based on the reference answer's style and intent.
[RESULT]: 4
