[PROMPT]: Who got Seward elected to the senate?
[USER_ANSWER]: William H. Seward was elected to the United States Senate by the New York State Legislature. In the 19th century, before the ratification of the 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Senators were not directly elected by the public but were chosen by their respective state legislatures. Seward, a member of the Whig Party and later the Republican Party, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1849 and served until 1861.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Weed
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation of the process by which William H. Seward was elected to the Senate, including historical context about the election process before the 17th Amendment. However, it does not directly answer the question of who specifically got Seward elected. The reference answer indicates that "Weed" was the person responsible, which is not mentioned in the response. Therefore, while the response is factually accurate about the election process, it does not address the specific individual who played a key role in Seward's election.
[RESULT]: 3
