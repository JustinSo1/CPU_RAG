[PROMPT]: What has Uruguay done to be competitive in agriculture?
[USER_ANSWER]: Uruguay has made several strategic moves to enhance its competitiveness in agriculture. Here are some key measures:

1. **Technological Advancements**: Uruguay has heavily invested in agricultural technology and innovation. The use of precision agriculture, biotechnology, and advanced farming techniques has increased productivity and efficiency.

2. **Quality Standards and Traceability**: The country has implemented rigorous quality control and traceability systems, particularly in the beef industry. This ensures high-quality produce and builds trust in international markets.

3. **Sustainable Practices**: Uruguay promotes sustainable agricultural practices to maintain soil health and reduce environmental impact. This includes crop rotation, no-till farming, and integrated pest management.

4. **Diversification**: The country has diversified its agricultural base beyond traditional products like beef and wool. It now produces soybeans, rice, dairy products, and citrus fruits, reducing dependency on a single commodity.

5. **Export-Oriented Policies**: Uruguay has established free trade agreements and maintained favorable trade relations with key markets such as China, the European Union, and the United States. This helps in gaining better market access and competitive pricing.

6. **Research and Development**: The government supports agricultural research institutions like INIA (National Institute for Agricultural Research), which works on developing new crop varieties, improving animal genetics, and studying climate resilience.

7. **Education and Training**: There is a strong emphasis on agricultural education and training programs to ensure that farmers are well-equipped with modern knowledge and skills.

8. **Infrastructure Improvement**: Investments in rural infrastructure, such as roads, ports, and irrigation systems, have been made to support agricultural activities and reduce logistical costs.

9. **Cooperative Models**: The promotion of cooperative models in agriculture allows small and medium-sized farmers to pool resources, share knowledge, and improve bargaining power.

10. **Government Support**: The Uruguayan government provides financial support, subsidies, and incentives for farmers to adopt modern agricultural practices and technologies.

These strategies have collectively helped Uruguay to enhance its agricultural productivity, maintain high-quality standards, and remain competitive in the global market.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Labeling as "Natural" or "Ecological"
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is detailed and covers a wide range of strategies that Uruguay has implemented to enhance its competitiveness in agriculture. However, the reference answer is very specific, mentioning "Labeling as 'Natural' or 'Ecological'." The response does not directly address this specific point, which is crucial according to the reference answer. While the response is factually accurate and provides a comprehensive overview of Uruguay's agricultural strategies, it does not align with the specific focus of the reference answer.
