[PROMPT]: What was Roosevelt's justification for supporting desegregation of schools in New York?
[USER_ANSWER]: Franklin D. Roosevelt did not specifically support desegregation of schools in New York during his presidency, as the major push for desegregation occurred after his time in office. The landmark Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, came in 1954, nearly a decade after Roosevelt's death.

However, if you are referring to Eleanor Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt's wife, she was a strong advocate for civil rights and supported desegregation. Eleanor Roosevelt believed in the principles of equality and justice, and she used her platform to speak out against racial discrimination. She worked with and supported civil rights leaders, such as Walter White and Mary McLeod Bethune, and was an active member of the NAACP. Her advocacy was based on the belief that all Americans, regardless of race, deserved equal access to education and opportunities.

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Noting that his children had been educated with other races and there was nothing wrong with it
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The question specifically asks about Franklin D. Roosevelt's justification for supporting desegregation of schools in New York. The response incorrectly states that Franklin D. Roosevelt did not support desegregation of schools, and instead, it discusses Eleanor Roosevelt's advocacy for civil rights. The reference answer clearly indicates that Franklin D. Roosevelt justified desegregation by noting that his children had been educated with other races and there was nothing wrong with it. The response does not address this justification at all and provides irrelevant information about Eleanor Roosevelt.
[RESULT]: 2
