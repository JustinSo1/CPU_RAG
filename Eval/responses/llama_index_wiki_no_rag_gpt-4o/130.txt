[PROMPT]: What is the largest religious group in Canada?
[USER_ANSWER]: The largest religious group in Canada is Christianity. According to the most recent census data, the majority of Canadians identify as Christians, with Roman Catholicism being the largest denomination within Christianity. Other significant Christian denominations in Canada include the United Church of Canada, Anglican Church, and various Protestant groups. However, it's important to note that Canada is a multicultural and religiously diverse country, with a growing number of people identifying as having no religious affiliation.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: According to 2001 census, 77.1% of Canadians identified as being Christians; of this, Catholics make up the largest group (43.6% of Canadians). The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada; about 16.5% of Canadians declare no religious affiliation, and the remaining 6.3% were affiliated with religions other than Christianity, of which the largest is Islam numbering 1.9%, followed by Judaism: 1.1%. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Christianity as the largest religious group in Canada and mentions Roman Catholicism as the largest denomination within Christianity, which aligns with the reference answer. It also accurately notes the presence of other significant Christian denominations and the growing number of people with no religious affiliation. However, the response lacks specific statistical data provided in the reference answer, such as the exact percentages of Christians, Catholics, and other religious affiliations. While the response is mostly correct and factual, the absence of detailed statistics prevents it from being completely accurate.
[RESULT]: 4
