[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln's Wife's Family support slavery?
[USER_ANSWER]: Mary Todd Lincoln, the wife of President Abraham Lincoln, came from a prominent and wealthy family in Lexington, Kentucky. The Todd family had divided loyalties regarding the issue of slavery and the Civil War. While some members of her family supported the Confederacy and slavery, others were Unionists.

Mary's father, Robert Smith Todd, was a prosperous businessman and slaveholder, which indicates that at least some members of her immediate family supported the institution of slavery. However, Mary herself did not publicly support slavery and stood by her husband, Abraham Lincoln, who was a staunch opponent of the expansion of slavery and eventually issued the Emancipation Proclamation to free slaves in the Confederate states.

The divided loyalties within Mary Todd Lincoln's family led to significant personal conflict, especially during the Civil War, as she had relatives who fought for the Confederacy.
