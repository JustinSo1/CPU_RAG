[PROMPT]: Was Gellu Naum the leader of the surrealist movement in Romania ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Gellu Naum was indeed a significant figure in the Romanian surrealist movement, but it would be more accurate to describe him as one of the leading figures rather than the sole leader. Alongside other prominent surrealists like Gherasim Luca, Paul PÄƒun, Virgil Teodorescu, and Dolfi Trost, Naum played a crucial role in the development and promotion of surrealism in Romania. His contributions, through both his poetic and prose works, were influential in shaping the movement within the country.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation that Gellu Naum was a significant figure in the Romanian surrealist movement, but not the sole leader. This aligns with the reference answer, which simply states "Yes," implying that Naum was indeed a key figure. However, the response goes beyond the reference answer by mentioning other prominent surrealists and elaborating on Naum's contributions, which, while informative, is not necessary for the given task. The response is accurate but slightly over-explains the context.
[RESULT]: 4
