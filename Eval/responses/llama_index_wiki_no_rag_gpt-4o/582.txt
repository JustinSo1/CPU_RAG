[PROMPT]: Can otters survive in cold water?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, otters are well-adapted to survive in cold water. There are several species of otters, and many of them live in environments where the water can be quite cold. They have a number of adaptations that help them cope with these conditions:

1. **Dense Fur**: Otters have one of the densest fur coats of any animal, with up to a million hairs per square inch. This dense fur traps a layer of air close to their skin, which helps to insulate them against the cold.

2. **High Metabolism**: Otters have a high metabolic rate, which helps generate body heat to keep them warm. They need to eat a lot of food to maintain this metabolic rate, and their diet typically includes fish, crustaceans, and other aquatic organisms.

3. **Body Fat**: Some otter species, like sea otters, have a layer of body fat that provides additional insulation.

4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Otters often engage in behaviors that help them stay warm, such as grooming their fur to maintain its insulating properties and seeking out sheltered areas to rest.

These adaptations enable otters to thrive in cold water environments, from the icy waters of the North Pacific Ocean to the cold rivers and lakes in various parts of the world.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about the adaptations that allow otters to survive in cold water, including their dense fur, high metabolism, body fat, and behavioral adaptations. This level of detail goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer but remains entirely accurate and factual.
[RESULT]: 5
