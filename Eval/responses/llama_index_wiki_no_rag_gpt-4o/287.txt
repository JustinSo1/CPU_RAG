[PROMPT]: What does the word Ghana mean?
[USER_ANSWER]: The name "Ghana" is derived from the ancient Ghana Empire, which was located in what is now southeastern Mauritania and western Mali. The word "Ghana" itself means "Warrior King" or "King of Gold" in the Soninke language, reflecting the wealth and strength of the ancient empire. The modern country of Ghana, located in West Africa, adopted this name upon gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1957, to signify a connection to the rich history and heritage of the region.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: warrior king
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about the origin of the name "Ghana," mentioning its derivation from the ancient Ghana Empire and its meaning in the Soninke language. However, the reference answer simply states "warrior king," which is a more concise and direct answer. While the response includes additional accurate information, it slightly deviates from the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. Therefore, it is mostly correct, accurate, and factual, but not completely aligned with the reference answer's brevity.
[RESULT]: 4
