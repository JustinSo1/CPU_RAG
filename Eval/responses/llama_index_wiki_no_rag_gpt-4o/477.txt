[PROMPT]: Is a collision with a vehicle capable of killing a kangaroo ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, a collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo. Kangaroos often suffer severe injuries or death when hit by vehicles due to the high speed and mass of the vehicle. Additionally, such collisions can also cause significant damage to the vehicle and pose serious risks to the occupants. It's important for drivers in areas where kangaroos are common to be vigilant, especially during dawn and dusk when kangaroos are most active.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation that aligns with the reference answer, which is a simple "yes." The additional information about the severity of injuries to kangaroos, the potential damage to vehicles, and the importance of driver vigilance in areas with kangaroos is accurate and relevant. However, the reference answer is very brief, and the response goes beyond what was required, though it does not detract from the correctness of the answer.
[RESULT]: 5
