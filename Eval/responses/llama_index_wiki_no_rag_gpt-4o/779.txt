[PROMPT]: Why did Roosevelt start Boxing lessons?
[USER_ANSWER]: Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, started boxing lessons during his time at Harvard University. He was a sickly child, suffering from asthma and other health issues, and he took up physical activities to build his strength and improve his health. Boxing was one of the various sports he engaged in to develop his physical fitness, resilience, and combat skills. Roosevelt's interest in boxing continued throughout his life, and he even sparred occasionally while serving as president. His commitment to physical fitness was part of his broader philosophy of maintaining a vigorous and active lifestyle.
