[PROMPT]: Oxygen is what?
[USER_ANSWER]: Oxygen is a chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a highly reactive nonmetal and an oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds, most notably oxides, with most elements. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. In its diatomic form (O2), it is a colorless, tasteless, and odorless gas that is essential for the respiration of most living organisms and is a key component of the Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen also occurs in water (H2O) and in many minerals and rocks.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: One kind of gas obtained via a tracheal system.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate description of oxygen, including its chemical properties, abundance, and significance in various forms. However, it does not align with the reference answer, which focuses on a specific biological context (obtained via a tracheal system). While the response is factually correct, it does not directly address the specific context provided in the reference answer. Therefore, it is mostly correct, accurate, and factual but not completely aligned with the reference answer's context.
[RESULT]: 4
