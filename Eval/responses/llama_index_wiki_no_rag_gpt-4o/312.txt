[PROMPT]: Did Grover Cleveland support women's suffrage?
[USER_ANSWER]: Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President of the United States, did not support women's suffrage. During his presidency in the late 19th century, Cleveland held traditional views on gender roles. He believed that women's primary responsibilities were in the domestic sphere and did not advocate for their right to vote. His stance was consistent with the prevailing attitudes of many politicians and members of society during that period. It wasn't until after Cleveland's time in office that the women's suffrage movement gained significant momentum, eventually leading to the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which granted women the right to vote.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately states that Grover Cleveland did not support women's suffrage and provides context about his traditional views on gender roles and the societal attitudes of the time. However, the reference answer is a simple "No," which is a more direct and concise response to the question. While the additional context in the evaluated response is informative, it is not necessary for the accuracy of the answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
