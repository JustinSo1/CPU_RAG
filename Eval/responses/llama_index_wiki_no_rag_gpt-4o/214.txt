[PROMPT]: What part of an elephant is very important for temperature regulation?
[USER_ANSWER]: The ears of an elephant are very important for temperature regulation. Elephants have large ears that are rich in blood vessels. By flapping their ears, they can help to cool the blood that flows through the vessels, which in turn helps to lower their overall body temperature. This adaptation is particularly important for elephants, which often live in hot environments.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Ears
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It identifies the ears as the important part for temperature regulation in elephants and provides additional details about how the ears help in cooling the blood and regulating body temperature. This explanation aligns well with the reference answer and adds valuable context.
[RESULT]: 5
