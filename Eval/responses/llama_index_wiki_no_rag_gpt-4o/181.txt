[PROMPT]: Are there a large number of Jews living in Egypt today?
[USER_ANSWER]: As of the most recent data available up to October 2023, the Jewish community in Egypt is extremely small. The Jewish population in Egypt has significantly declined over the past century due to various factors, including emigration and historical events such as the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, subsequent Arab-Israeli conflicts, and social and political changes in Egypt. Today, only a handful of Jews remain in the country, mostly in Cairo and Alexandria. The exact number is difficult to determine but is estimated to be fewer than a hundred individuals.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation about the current Jewish population in Egypt, mentioning the significant decline over the past century and the factors contributing to this decline. The response also accurately states that only a handful of Jews remain in Egypt today, mostly in Cairo and Alexandria, and estimates the number to be fewer than a hundred individuals. However, the reference answer is a simple "no," which directly answers the question without additional context. While the detailed response is informative, it goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
