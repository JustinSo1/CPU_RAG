[PROMPT]: Who makes up Ghana's Parliament?
[USER_ANSWER]: Ghana's Parliament is a unicameral legislative body composed of Members of Parliament (MPs). These MPs are elected to represent various constituencies across the country. The Parliament is made up of 275 MPs who are elected every four years during the general elections. The Speaker of Parliament presides over the parliamentary sessions. Additionally, there are majority and minority leaders, deputy speakers, and various parliamentary committees that oversee different areas of governance and policy. The composition of Parliament reflects the political parties that have won seats, with the two main parties being the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC), among other smaller parties and independent members.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: the New Patriotic Party and National Democratic Congress
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate description of the composition of Ghana's Parliament, including the number of MPs, their election process, the role of the Speaker, and the presence of majority and minority leaders. It also mentions the two main political parties, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC), which aligns with the reference answer. However, the reference answer is very brief and only mentions the two main parties, while the response includes additional relevant details about the structure and function of Parliament. Despite the extra information, the response is factually correct and aligns with the reference answer in terms of the key elements.
