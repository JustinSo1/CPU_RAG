[PROMPT]: Is it true that romania has a population of 21,698,181?
[USER_ANSWER]: The population of Romania can fluctuate over time due to various factors such as birth rates, death rates, and migration. As of the most recent estimates and data available up to 2023, Romania's population is around 19 million. The figure you mentioned, 21,698,181, may have been accurate in the past but is not reflective of the current population. For the most up-to-date and accurate information, it is always best to refer to the latest data from reliable sources such as the National Institute of Statistics in Romania or international organizations like the United Nations.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about the factors affecting population changes and mentions the most recent estimates, stating that Romania's population is around 19 million as of 2023. While this information is accurate and factual, it does not directly answer the question with a simple "yes" or "no" as the reference answer does. The response is mostly correct and factual but lacks the directness and simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
