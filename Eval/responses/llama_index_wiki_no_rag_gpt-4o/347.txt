[PROMPT]: Is there a becquerel crater on the moon and a becquerel crater on mars?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, there is a Becquerel crater on both the Moon and Mars. 

On the Moon, Becquerel is a relatively small impact crater located in the highland region on the far side of the Moon. It is named after the French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel, who discovered radioactivity.

On Mars, Becquerel is a larger crater situated in the Arabia Terra region of the planet. This crater is of particular interest to scientists because of the layered sediments found within it, which suggest a history of water activity.

Both craters are named in honor of the same scientist, reflecting his significant contributions to the field of physics.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It confirms the existence of Becquerel craters on both the Moon and Mars, providing additional details about their locations and significance. The information about the craters being named after Antoine Henri Becquerel and the scientific interest in the Martian crater's sediments is accurate and enhances the response. This level of detail, while not necessary, does not detract from the correctness of the answer.
[RESULT]: 5
