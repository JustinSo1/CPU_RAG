[PROMPT]: What happens when the srivijaya kingdom formed trade links?
[USER_ANSWER]: When the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links, several significant developments occurred that had a profound impact on the region and beyond:

1. **Economic Prosperity**: Srivijaya became a major maritime power and a central hub in the trade networks of Southeast Asia. It controlled the Strait of Malacca, a critical chokepoint for maritime trade between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. This strategic position allowed Srivijaya to collect tolls from passing ships and engage in lucrative trade with China, India, the Middle East, and other parts of Southeast Asia.

2. **Cultural Exchange**: The trade links facilitated the exchange of not only goods but also ideas, cultures, and religions. Srivijaya became a melting pot where different cultures and traditions met and interacted. This was particularly evident in the spread of Buddhism. Srivijaya was a major center for Mahayana Buddhism, attracting pilgrims and scholars from across Asia, including the famous Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing.

3. **Political Influence**: The wealth generated from trade allowed Srivijaya to maintain a powerful navy and a strong political presence in the region. It exerted influence over smaller neighboring states and played a significant role in regional politics. The kingdom established diplomatic relations with major powers such as China and India, which helped to secure its position and foster further trade.

4. **Technological and Knowledge Transfer**: The trade links also facilitated the transfer of technology and knowledge. Srivijaya was exposed to advancements from other civilizations, which included innovations in shipbuilding, navigation, and various other technologies. These advancements helped to further enhance the kingdomâ€™s maritime capabilities and trade efficiency.

5. **Urban Development**: The prosperity from trade led to the growth of urban centers within Srivijaya. Palembang, the capital, became a bustling cosmopolitan center with impressive infrastructure, including monasteries, marketplaces, and ports. The influx of wealth and people contributed to the development of urban areas and the overall advancement of the kingdom.

6. **Decline and Legacy**: Over time, Srivijaya faced competition from other emerging powers, such as the Chola dynasty from India, which launched a significant raid on Srivijaya in the 11th century. Additionally, the rise of other trading kingdoms in the region, such as the Majapahit Empire and the Sultanate of Malacca, contributed to its decline. Despite its eventual fall, the legacy of Srivijaya's trade network had a lasting impact on the region's economic and cultural landscape.

In summary, the formation of trade links by the Srivijaya Kingdom led to economic prosperity, cultural exchange, political influence, technological transfer, urban development, and a lasting legacy that shaped the history of Southeast Asia.
