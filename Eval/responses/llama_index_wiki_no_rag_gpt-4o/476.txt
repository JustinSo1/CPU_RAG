[PROMPT]: Have Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise been known to leap in front of cars ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, kangaroos are known to leap in front of cars, and this behavior is often attributed to their being dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise. Kangaroos, like many other animals, can become disoriented and confused by the bright lights of oncoming vehicles, especially at night. Their natural instinct when frightened may be to leap away quickly, which can unfortunately lead them to jump directly into the path of oncoming cars. This is a significant concern in areas where kangaroos are common, and it contributes to vehicle collisions involving these animals. Drivers in regions with high kangaroo populations are often advised to be particularly cautious, especially during dawn and dusk when kangaroos are most active.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation that aligns with the reference answer, which is a simple "yes." The response elaborates on the reasons why kangaroos might leap in front of cars, mentioning being dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise, and discusses the implications for drivers. However, the reference answer is very brief, and the response, while accurate, goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer. This additional detail, while informative, is not necessary to meet the criteria of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
