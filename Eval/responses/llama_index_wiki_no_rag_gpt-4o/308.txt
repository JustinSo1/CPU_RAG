[PROMPT]: What type of tools do biologists use to capture wolves for tagging?
[USER_ANSWER]: Biologists use a variety of tools and techniques to capture wolves for tagging, ensuring minimal stress and harm to the animals. Some of the commonly used methods include:

1. **Tranquilizer Darts**: These darts are used to safely sedate wolves from a distance. They are typically delivered using a dart gun or rifle.

2. **Foot-Hold Traps**: Specially designed padded or rubber-lined traps are used to capture wolves without injuring them. These traps are checked frequently to ensure the captured animal does not remain in the trap for too long.

3. **Box Traps**: These are large, baited enclosures that capture wolves alive. They are generally used in areas where wolves are more likely to enter the trap out of curiosity or hunger.

4. **Helicopter Netting**: In some cases, biologists use helicopters to locate wolves and then capture them using a net gun. This method allows for quick and efficient capture, especially in open terrain where other methods might be less effective.

5. **Snares**: Cable snares are sometimes used, although they must be carefully monitored to prevent injury. These snares are designed to capture the wolf by the neck or foot.

6. **Chemical Immobilization**: Once a wolf is captured using any of the above methods, it may be further sedated with injectable drugs to ensure it remains calm and still during the tagging process.

These methods are employed by trained professionals who follow strict guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of the wolves.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Darting and Foot hold traps.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate list of tools and techniques used by biologists to capture wolves for tagging. It includes tranquilizer darts, foot-hold traps, box traps, helicopter netting, snares, and chemical immobilization. While the reference answer only mentions darting and foot-hold traps, the response expands on these methods and includes additional relevant techniques. The information is correct and factual, aligning with the reference answer, though it is more comprehensive.
[RESULT]: 4
