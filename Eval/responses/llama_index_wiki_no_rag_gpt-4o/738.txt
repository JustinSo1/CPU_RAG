[PROMPT]: Did the media contribute 15.6% to Singapore's GDP in 2001?
[USER_ANSWER]: In 2001, the media sector did not contribute 15.6% to Singapore's GDP. The media industry, while significant, was a smaller portion of the overall economy. The primary contributors to Singapore's GDP typically include manufacturing, finance, trade, and services. The media sector, including entertainment and publishing, would not have accounted for such a large percentage of the GDP. Accurate and specific figures can be found through historical economic reports from official sources such as the Singapore Department of Statistics.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No, it contributed 1.56% to GDP in 2001.
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly states that the media sector did not contribute 15.6% to Singapore's GDP in 2001, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it does not provide the specific figure of 1.56% as mentioned in the reference answer. While the response gives a general explanation about the media sector's contribution and mentions other major sectors, it lacks the precise detail that would make it completely accurate and factual. Therefore, it is mostly correct but not completely accurate due to the omission of the specific percentage.
[RESULT]: 4
