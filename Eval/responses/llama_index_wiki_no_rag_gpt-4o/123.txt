[PROMPT]: Is Canada bilingual?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Canada is officially bilingual at the federal level, with both English and French recognized as official languages. This means that government services, legislation, and official communications are available in both languages. The bilingual nature of Canada reflects the country's history and its commitment to linguistic duality. However, the prevalence of bilingualism can vary significantly between regions. Quebec is predominantly French-speaking, while most other provinces and territories are primarily English-speaking. New Brunswick is the only province that is officially bilingual.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about Canada's bilingual status, including the recognition of both English and French as official languages at the federal level, the availability of government services in both languages, and the regional variations in bilingualism. However, the reference answer is very concise, simply stating "Yes." While the detailed response is informative, it goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
