[PROMPT]: Was the game of Marn grook played using a ball made from kangaroo by the Kurnai people ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Marn Grook, a traditional Indigenous Australian game believed to be played by various Aboriginal groups, did indeed involve the use of a ball. According to historical accounts and cultural records, the ball used in Marn Grook was often made from animal skin, including that of possums. While there is some evidence suggesting that different materials might have been used by different groups, it is not definitively documented that the Kurnai people specifically used kangaroo skin for their Marn Grook balls. The game's specific variations and the materials used could vary among different Aboriginal communities.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about the game of Marn Grook and the materials used for the ball. However, it does not directly answer the question with a simple "yes" or "no" as the reference answer does. The response suggests that it is not definitively documented that the Kurnai people used kangaroo skin, which implies a "no" answer, but it is not as clear and direct as the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is mostly accurate and factual, it lacks the directness and simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
