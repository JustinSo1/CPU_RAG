[PROMPT]: What dwindled and eventually died out, starting with the Hartford Convention?
[USER_ANSWER]: The Hartford Convention, which took place in late 1814 and early 1815, was a series of meetings in which the New England Federalist Party discussed their grievances concerning the War of 1812 and the political problems arising from the federal government's increasing power. This event is often seen as the beginning of the decline of the Federalist Party.

The Federalist Party's opposition to the War of 1812 and the perception of their disloyalty to the United States during the war were highly unpopular once the war ended and was seen as unpatriotic. The subsequent American victory and the surge of nationalistic pride greatly diminished the Federalist Party's influence and popularity. By the time of the "Era of Good Feelings" during James Monroe's presidency, the Federalist Party had effectively dwindled and ceased to be a major political force in the United States.

It provides a detailed explanation of the context and reasons for the decline of the Federalist Party, which aligns with the reference answer. The information is correct, accurate, and factual.
