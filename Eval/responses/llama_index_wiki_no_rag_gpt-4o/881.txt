[PROMPT]: What did Uruguay win in 1828?
[USER_ANSWER]: In 1828, Uruguay achieved its independence from Brazil after the Cisplatine War, which is also known as the Argentina-Brazil War. The conflict concluded with the signing of the Treaty of Montevideo, mediated by the United Kingdom. This treaty recognized Uruguay, then known as the Cisplatine Province, as an independent nation, establishing it as the Oriental Republic of Uruguay.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Its independence
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation of the events surrounding Uruguay's independence in 1828, including the Cisplatine War, the Treaty of Montevideo, and the role of the United Kingdom in mediating the treaty. However, the reference answer is concise and directly states "its independence," which is the core information required. The response, while accurate, includes additional context that, while informative, is not necessary to answer the question directly.
[RESULT]: 4
