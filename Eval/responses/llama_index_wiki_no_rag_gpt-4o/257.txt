[PROMPT]: Is Ford related with the assassination of John F. Kennedy?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, Ford is not related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Lee Harvey Oswald was identified as the assassin, although many conspiracy theories have arisen over the years. Gerald Ford, who later became the 38th President of the United States, served on the Warren Commission, which investigated Kennedy's assassination, but there is no direct connection between Ford and the act of assassination itself.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Gerald Ford was not directly related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy and provides additional context about the assassination and Ford's role in the Warren Commission. However, the reference answer is simply "Yes," which suggests that the response should have acknowledged some form of connection, albeit indirect, between Ford and the assassination. The response's detailed explanation, while informative, does not align perfectly with the reference answer's simplicity and directness.
[RESULT]: 4
