[PROMPT]: What did Cleveland's opponents say in 1884 to counter his innocent image?
[USER_ANSWER]: In the 1884 presidential election, Grover Cleveland's opponents sought to tarnish his reputation by bringing up a scandal from his past. They publicized allegations that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was a lawyer in Buffalo, New York. The Republican Party used the slogan "Ma, Ma, where's my Pa?" to emphasize this scandal and counter Cleveland's image of integrity and honesty. Despite the controversy, Cleveland admitted to the relationship and took responsibility for the child, which may have helped mitigate some of the negative impact. He ultimately won the presidency, suggesting that voters were either willing to overlook the issue or appreciated his forthrightness.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: That he had fathered an illegitimate child
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately describes the scandal involving Grover Cleveland and the illegitimate child, which his opponents used to counter his innocent image. The mention of the slogan "Ma, Ma, where's my Pa?" is also accurate and relevant. However, the response includes additional context about Cleveland's admission and the election outcome, which, while informative, goes beyond the scope of the question. The core information about the scandal is correctly conveyed, but the extra details are not necessary for a perfect score based on the rubric.
[RESULT]: 4
