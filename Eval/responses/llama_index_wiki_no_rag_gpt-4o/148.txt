[PROMPT]: Are ducks in the Arctic Northern Hemisphere migratory?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, many duck species in the Arctic Northern Hemisphere are migratory. These ducks breed in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions during the summer when the conditions are favorable and food is abundant. As the colder months approach and the temperatures drop, these ducks migrate to warmer regions in the south to find suitable habitats and food sources. Common migratory duck species in the Arctic include the Northern Pintail, the Long-tailed Duck, and the Common Eider. Migration is a crucial part of their life cycle, allowing them to survive in varying environmental conditions throughout the year.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Some are
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about the migratory behavior of ducks in the Arctic Northern Hemisphere, including specific species and reasons for migration. However, the reference answer is very brief and only states "Some are," which implies that not all ducks in the Arctic Northern Hemisphere are migratory. The evaluated response does not explicitly acknowledge that some ducks may not be migratory, which is a slight deviation from the reference answer's implication. Therefore, while the response is informative and mostly accurate, it does not fully align with the reference answer's brevity and implication.
[RESULT]: 4
