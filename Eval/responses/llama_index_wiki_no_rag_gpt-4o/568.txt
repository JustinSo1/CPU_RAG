[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1846
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides the correct founding date of the University of Buffalo, which is May 11, 1846. However, the reference answer only requires the year 1846. While the additional details about the university's history and Millard Fillmore are accurate, they are not necessary for the specific question asked. Therefore, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual but includes more information than required.
