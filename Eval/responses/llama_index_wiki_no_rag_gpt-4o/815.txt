[PROMPT]: Where do sea turtles lay their eggs?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sea turtles typically lay their eggs on sandy beaches. Female sea turtles come ashore, usually at night, to dig nests in the sand where they deposit their eggs. They use their flippers to dig a hole, lay their eggs (which can number from 50 to over 200 depending on the species), and then cover the nest with sand to camouflage it from predators. After laying their eggs, the female turtles return to the ocean, leaving the eggs to incubate under the warmth of the sand. The hatchlings emerge after about 6 to 10 weeks, depending on the species and environmental conditions, and instinctively make their way to the ocean.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Holes Dug into the Mud or Sand
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about the process of sea turtles laying their eggs on sandy beaches, which aligns with the reference answer indicating that sea turtles lay their eggs in holes dug into the sand. However, the response does not mention the possibility of laying eggs in mud, which is a minor detail but still relevant. Overall, the response is comprehensive and informative, but it slightly misses the complete accuracy by not including the mud aspect.
[RESULT]: 4
