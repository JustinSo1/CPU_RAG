[PROMPT]: When did Lincoln begin his political career?
[USER_ANSWER]: Abraham Lincoln began his political career in 1832 when he ran for the Illinois General Assembly. Although he was not elected in that initial attempt, he continued to pursue a career in politics and was subsequently elected to the Illinois state legislature in 1834.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1832
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that Abraham Lincoln began his political career in 1832, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it includes additional information about his subsequent political activities, which, while accurate, is not necessary for the specific question asked. The extra details do not detract from the correctness of the initial answer but are beyond what was required.
[RESULT]: 4
