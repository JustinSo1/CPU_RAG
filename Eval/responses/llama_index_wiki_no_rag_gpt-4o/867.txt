[PROMPT]: Why was the capital of Uruguay founded?
[USER_ANSWER]: The capital of Uruguay, Montevideo, was founded in 1724 by Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, a Spanish soldier and colonial administrator. The primary reason for its establishment was strategic; the Spanish Crown wanted to establish a fortified city to counter the Portuguese advances from Brazil and to deter their influence in the region. At the time, the area was part of the broader territorial disputes between the Spanish and Portuguese empires in South America.

Montevideo's natural harbor was also seen as highly valuable for its potential as a commercial port and naval base, which would help the Spanish solidify their control over the surrounding territories. Over time, Montevideo grew in importance and became a central hub for trade, governance, and military operations, eventually evolving into the capital city of independent Uruguay.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: For a military stronghold.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual.

Additionally, the response includes extra context about the Spanish-Portuguese territorial disputes and the commercial significance of Montevideo's harbor, which, while not mentioned in the reference answer, does not detract from the accuracy of the primary reason given. However, the response could be more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer to achieve a perfect score.
