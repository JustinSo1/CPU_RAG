[PROMPT]: Where did Orang Laut people live?
[USER_ANSWER]: The Orang Laut, also known as the "sea people" or "sea gypsies," traditionally lived in the coastal areas and islands of the Malay Archipelago. This region includes parts of present-day Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. They are known for their maritime lifestyle, often living on boats and relying on the sea for their livelihood. The Orang Laut were historically significant in the region for their knowledge of the sea, navigation skills, and their role in regional trade networks.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Orang Laut people lived around the coast, rivers and smaller islands.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about the Orang Laut people, including their traditional living areas in the coastal regions and islands of the Malay Archipelago, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the response includes additional details about their maritime lifestyle, navigation skills, and role in regional trade networks, which, while accurate, are not directly requested by the instruction. The core information about their living areas is accurate but slightly more detailed than necessary.
[RESULT]: 4
