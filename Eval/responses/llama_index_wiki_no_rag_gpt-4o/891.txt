[PROMPT]: Did Woodrow Wilson create the League of Nations?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Woodrow Wilson played a key role in the creation of the League of Nations. He was the 28th President of the United States and a leading advocate for the establishment of the League, which was intended to be an international organization to promote peace and cooperation among countries. The League of Nations was one of Wilson's Fourteen Points, a set of principles he proposed for the post-World War I peace settlement. The League was established in 1920 as part of the Treaty of Versailles. However, it is worth noting that despite Wilson's efforts, the United States Senate did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles, and as a result, the United States did not join the League of Nations.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately states that Woodrow Wilson played a key role in the creation of the League of Nations and provides relevant context about his presidency, the Fourteen Points, and the Treaty of Versailles. However, the reference answer is extremely concise, and the response, while detailed, goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer. The additional information about the U.S. Senate not ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, while accurate, is not necessary to answer the question directly. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
