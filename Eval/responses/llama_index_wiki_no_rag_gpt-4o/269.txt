[PROMPT]: Was Ford released from the hospital?
[USER_ANSWER]: As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time information. To find out whether Ford was released from the hospital, I recommend checking the latest news sources or official statements.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question of whether Ford was released from the hospital. Instead, it provides information about the model's limitations and suggests checking other sources for the answer. This makes the response not factual or accurate in relation to the reference answer, which is a straightforward "Yes." Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for correctness, accuracy, or factuality based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
