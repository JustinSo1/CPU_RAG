[PROMPT]: Did ford get an award called "Congressman's congressman"?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Gerald Ford, who later became the 38th President of the United States, was often called the "Congressman's Congressman" due to his deep respect and understanding of the legislative process and his ability to work collaboratively across party lines. This title was more of an informal recognition rather than an official award. His colleagues in Congress appreciated his integrity, fairness, and dedication, which contributed to this nickname.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about Gerald Ford being called the "Congressman's Congressman," which is accurate and factual. However, the instruction specifically asks if Ford received an award called "Congressman's congressman," and the reference answer is simply "Yes." The response clarifies that it was more of an informal recognition rather than an official award, which is important context but not directly addressing the question as succinctly as the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is mostly correct and factual, it includes additional information that slightly deviates from the directness of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
