As of recent data, it serves numerous airlines and connects Singapore to a wide array of cities around the world. While the exact numbers can fluctuate, the figures you mentioned—81 airlines connecting Singapore to 185 cities in 58 countries—are reflective of the airport's significant connectivity. For the most current and specific details, it's always best to check the latest information directly from the airport or relevant aviation authorities.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a general overview of Singapore Changi Airport's connectivity and acknowledges the extensive network of airlines and destinations. However, it does not directly confirm the specific numbers mentioned in the question (81 airlines, 185 cities, 58 countries). Instead, it suggests that these figures are reflective of the airport's connectivity but advises checking the latest information for accuracy. This makes the response somewhat accurate but not completely factual or direct as the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
