[PROMPT]: The Celsius crater on the Moon is what?
[USER_ANSWER]: The Celsius crater is a lunar impact crater located in the southern highlands of the Moon. It is named after the Swedish astronomer and physicist Anders Celsius, who is best known for the Celsius temperature scale. The crater has a diameter of approximately 37 kilometers. The rim of Celsius crater is heavily worn and eroded, and it has been overlain by subsequent impacts over the eons. The interior floor is relatively flat and lacks a central peak, which is common in craters of this size. The location and features of Celsius crater make it an interesting subject for lunar observations and studies.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: named after him
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate description of the Celsius crater on the Moon, including its location, naming origin, size, and physical characteristics. However, the reference answer is very brief and only mentions that the crater is named after Anders Celsius. While the response is factually correct and provides additional relevant information, it goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer. Based on the rubric, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual, but it includes more detail than necessary.
[RESULT]: 4
