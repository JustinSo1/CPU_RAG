[PROMPT]: Is Liechtenstein heavily urbanized?
[USER_ANSWER]: Liechtenstein is not heavily urbanized compared to many other countries. It is a small, landlocked nation situated between Switzerland and Austria, with an area of just over 160 square kilometers (about 62 square miles) and a population of around 40,000 people. The country is characterized by its mountainous terrain and rural landscapes.

While there are urban areas, such as the capital city of Vaduz and the largest municipality, Schaan, much of Liechtenstein's population lives in smaller towns and villages. The urbanization level is relatively low, and the country maintains a balance between developed areas and natural surroundings.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about Liechtenstein's urbanization level, mentioning its small size, population, and the presence of urban areas like Vaduz and Schaan. However, the reference answer is a simple "No," indicating that a brief and direct response is expected. While the detailed response is accurate and factual, it does not align with the simplicity of the reference answer. Therefore, it is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the expected brevity.
[RESULT]: 4
