[PROMPT]: Did Horace Greenley lose in the presidential elections of 1872?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Horace Greeley did lose in the presidential election of 1872. He was the candidate for both the Liberal Republican Party and the Democratic Party, but he was defeated by the incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant, who was the Republican Party candidate. Greeley actually died before the Electoral College cast its votes, and the electoral votes that would have gone to him were distributed among several other candidates.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It provides additional context about Horace Greeley's candidacy and the outcome of the 1872 presidential election, including the fact that he was a candidate for both the Liberal Republican Party and the Democratic Party, and that he was defeated by Ulysses S. Grant. The response also accurately mentions that Greeley died before the Electoral College cast its votes, and that his electoral votes were distributed among other candidates. This additional information, while not necessary, does not detract from the accuracy of the response.
[RESULT]: 5
