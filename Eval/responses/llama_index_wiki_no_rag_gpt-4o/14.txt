[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides the exact date when Abraham Lincoln first served as President, which matches the reference answer. However, it includes additional information about Lincoln being the 16th President, which, while accurate, is not necessary for the specific question asked. The extra detail does not detract from the correctness of the response but makes it slightly more verbose than required.
