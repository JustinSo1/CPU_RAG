[PROMPT]: Why did Indonesia break off relations with the People's Republic of China?
[USER_ANSWER]: Indonesia severed diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1967, largely due to the political turmoil and anti-communist sentiment that followed the attempted coup in Indonesia on September 30, 1965. This coup attempt, which was blamed on the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), led to a violent anti-communist purge across the country. During this period, there was widespread suspicion that the PRC had supported the PKI, which fueled negative sentiments towards China.

The new Indonesian government under General Suharto, who rose to power following the coup attempt, adopted an anti-communist stance and sought to distance itself from communist countries. This led to the formal suspension of diplomatic relations with the PRC in 1967. The severance of ties was part of Indonesia's broader alignment with Western and anti-communist blocs during the Cold War.

Diplomatic relations between Indonesia and the PRC were not restored until 1990, when the geopolitical landscape had shifted, and both countries saw mutual benefits in re-establishing ties.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: because of anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation of the reasons behind Indonesia's decision to break off relations with the People's Republic of China, including the political turmoil following the 1965 coup attempt, the anti-communist purge, and the suspicion of PRC's support for the PKI. It also correctly identifies the new government's anti-communist stance under General Suharto and the broader Cold War context. However, the reference answer is much more concise, focusing solely on the anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era. While the response is accurate, it includes additional context that, while relevant, is not strictly necessary to answer the question as succinctly as the reference answer.
