4. **Live Sales**: Ducks can be sold live for various purposes, including breeding, ornamental uses, and as pets. Certain breeds are particularly valued for their appearance and are kept by enthusiasts.

5. **Pest Control**: Ducks can be used in agriculture to control pests. They are known to eat insects, snails, and weeds, making them a natural method for managing pests in rice paddies and other crops.

6. **Ecosystem Services**: Ducks can contribute to the health of aquatic ecosystems by controlling the population of certain pests and contributing to nutrient cycling. Their presence can improve the biodiversity and resilience of wetland environments.

7. **Tourism and Recreation**: In some areas, ducks are part of wildlife tourism and recreational activities, such as bird watching and hunting. Duck hunting can be a significant economic activity, generating revenue through licensing, equipment sales, and guided tours.

8. **Cultural and Educational Uses**: Ducks are used in cultural practices, traditional ceremonies, and educational programs. They can be part of demonstrations, agricultural fairs, and school programs that teach about farming, biology, and environmental conservation.
