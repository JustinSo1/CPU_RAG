[PROMPT]: Are penguins astonishingly agile?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, penguins are quite agile, especially in the water. While they might appear clumsy and awkward on land, their bodies are perfectly adapted for swimming. Penguins use their flippers to propel themselves through the water with remarkable speed and agility, reaching speeds of up to 15 miles per hour (24 kilometers per hour) in some species. Their streamlined bodies reduce drag, and their strong flippers allow them to make quick, agile turns to evade predators and catch prey. On ice and rocky terrain, they may not seem as graceful, but they can still move quickly by tobogganingâ€”sliding on their bellies while using their flippers and feet to push themselves forward.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: In the water they are.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about penguins' agility in the water, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it also includes additional information about their movement on land, which is not directly relevant to the question. While this extra detail does not detract from the accuracy of the information provided, it does go beyond the scope of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
