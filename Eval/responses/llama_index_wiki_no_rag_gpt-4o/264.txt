[PROMPT]: Has another US President been an Eagle Scout?
[USER_ANSWER]: As of my last update in October 2023, no U.S. President has been an Eagle Scout. While many presidents have supported the Boy Scouts of America and some have had Scouting experience, none have reached the rank of Eagle Scout. Gerald Ford, the 38th President of the United States, was the closest as he achieved the rank of Life Scout, which is just one rank below Eagle Scout.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that no U.S. President has been an Eagle Scout, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about Gerald Ford and his rank of Life Scout, while accurate, is not necessary for the response and deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer. This extra detail does not detract from the correctness but makes the response more elaborate than required.
[RESULT]: 4
