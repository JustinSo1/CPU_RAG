[PROMPT]: Did continental European immigrants not S08_settle the prairies ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Continental European immigrants did indeed settle the prairies in North America. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, large waves of immigrants from countries such as Germany, Ukraine, Poland, Scandinavia, and others settled in the prairies of Canada and the United States.

In Canada, the government actively encouraged immigration to the prairies through the Dominion Lands Act of 1872, which offered free or inexpensive land to settlers. This policy attracted many European immigrants who established farms and contributed to the agricultural development of the region.

Similarly, in the United States, the Homestead Act of 1862 provided similar opportunities for settlers to acquire land, leading to significant European immigration to the Great Plains.

These immigrants played a crucial role in the development of the agricultural economy of the prairies, bringing with them farming techniques, traditions, and cultures that shaped the character of the region.
