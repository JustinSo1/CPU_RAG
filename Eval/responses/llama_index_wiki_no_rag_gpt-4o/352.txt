[PROMPT]: When did Islam become the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra?
[USER_ANSWER]: Islam became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra gradually over several centuries, a process that began in the late 13th century and continued into the 16th century. The spread of Islam in these regions was facilitated by traders, scholars, and missionaries from the Middle East, South Asia, and other parts of the Muslim world. Key factors in the spread of Islam included the establishment of Muslim trading communities, the conversion of local rulers, and the subsequent adoption of Islam by their subjects.

In Sumatra, the kingdom of Samudera Pasai on the northern coast became one of the earliest Islamic states in the late 13th century. By the 15th century, the influential Sultanate of Malacca on the Malay Peninsula, which had strong ties to Sumatra, had also converted to Islam, further boosting the religion's spread in the region.

In Java, the spread of Islam was slower but gained momentum in the 15th century with the conversion of the rulers of major port cities on the northern coast. The Demak Sultanate, established in the early 16th century, played a significant role in the spread of Islam throughout Java. By the end of the 16th century, Islam had become the dominant religion in both Java and Sumatra, although pockets of Hinduism, Buddhism, and indigenous beliefs persisted for some time.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: the end of the 16th century
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate account of the spread of Islam in Java and Sumatra, mentioning key periods, figures, and factors involved in the process. It correctly identifies the late 13th century as the beginning of the spread and the end of the 16th century as the point by which Islam had become dominant. This aligns well with the reference answer, which states "the end of the 16th century." The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual, though it provides more detail than the reference answer.
