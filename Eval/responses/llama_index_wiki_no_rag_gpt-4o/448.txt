[PROMPT]: Was James Cook the first to record the name "Kangooroo?"
[USER_ANSWER]: James Cook is often credited with recording one of the earliest known transcriptions of the word "kangaroo." During his first voyage to the Pacific in 1770, Cook and his crew encountered the animal in what is now Queensland, Australia. The word "kangaroo" is believed to have been derived from the Guugu Yimithirr word "gangurru," referring to a specific species of kangaroo.

Cook's naturalist, Sir Joseph Banks, and the artist Sydney Parkinson also documented the word and the animal. Although there is some debate about whether Cook and his crew accurately captured the local term, their recordings are among the earliest known Western records of the word "kangaroo."
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate account of James Cook's encounter with the word "kangaroo" and its origins. It correctly states that Cook and his crew recorded one of the earliest known transcriptions of the word during their voyage in 1770. The response also mentions the involvement of Cook's naturalist, Sir Joseph Banks, and the artist Sydney Parkinson, which adds to the factual accuracy. However, the response does not directly answer the question with a simple "yes" or "no," which is what the reference answer does. While the information is accurate and factual, it does not align perfectly with the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
