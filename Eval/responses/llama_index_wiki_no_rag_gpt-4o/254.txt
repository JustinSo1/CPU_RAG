[PROMPT]: Was Ford active about Vietnamese affairs?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, President Gerald Ford was involved in Vietnamese affairs during his presidency. He took office in August 1974, during the final stages of the Vietnam War. Ford faced the challenging task of managing the end of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. 

One of the critical moments of Ford's presidency was the fall of Saigon in April 1975. As North Vietnamese forces advanced, Ford ordered the evacuation of American personnel and thousands of South Vietnamese who had worked with the United States. The evacuation, known as Operation Frequent Wind, was the largest helicopter evacuation in history and marked the end of the Vietnam War.

Ford also dealt with the aftermath of the war, including the resettlement of Vietnamese refugees in the United States. He worked with Congress to secure funding and support for the resettlement process, demonstrating his administration's commitment to aiding those affected by the conflict.

Overall, Ford's presidency was significantly impacted by the conclusion of the Vietnam War and the subsequent humanitarian efforts.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer simply states "No," indicating that Ford was not active about Vietnamese affairs. However, the response provided a detailed account of Ford's involvement in the final stages of the Vietnam War, including the evacuation of American personnel and South Vietnamese allies, as well as the resettlement of Vietnamese refugees. This contradicts the reference answer and does not align with the expected response.
[RESULT]: 2
