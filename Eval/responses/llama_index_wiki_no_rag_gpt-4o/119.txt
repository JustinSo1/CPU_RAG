[PROMPT]: What was the Consitution Act formerly called?
[USER_ANSWER]: The Constitution Act, 1867 was formerly known as the British North America Act, 1867. This act, along with the Constitution Act, 1982, forms the core of Canada's Constitution. The British North America Act, 1867 was renamed when the Canadian Constitution was patriated from the United Kingdom in 1982.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The British North America Act.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that the Constitution Act, 1867 was formerly known as the British North America Act, 1867. However, the additional information about the Constitution Act, 1982 and the patriation of the Canadian Constitution, while accurate, is not necessary to answer the question directly. The extra details do not detract from the correctness of the main answer but are beyond the scope of the question asked.
[RESULT]: 4
