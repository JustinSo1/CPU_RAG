[PROMPT]: Are many beetles territorial?
[USER_ANSWER]: Beetle behavior varies widely across the numerous species, but territorial behavior is not particularly common among beetles. While some beetles do exhibit territoriality, it is more typical for them to focus on finding food, mates, and suitable habitats. For example, some species of dung beetles show territorial behavior by defending dung piles from rivals, as these piles are crucial for their reproduction. In contrast, many other beetle species are more solitary and do not display strong territorial tendencies. Overall, beetle behavior is highly diverse, and territoriality is just one aspect that can vary significantly among different species.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about beetle behavior, including examples of territorial behavior in some species like dung beetles. However, the reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that many beetles are territorial. The evaluated response suggests that territorial behavior is not particularly common among beetles, which contradicts the reference answer. Therefore, the response is not completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
