[PROMPT]: Who determined the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure?
[USER_ANSWER]: The relationship between the boiling point of water and atmospheric pressure was first systematically studied and described by the French physicist and chemist, Antoine Lavoisier, and later refined by the French chemist, Henri Victor Regnault. However, it was the Scottish chemist, Joseph Black, who made significant contributions to understanding the concept of latent heat, which is closely related to the boiling of water under varying atmospheric pressures. The relationship is now well understood: water boils at lower temperatures at higher altitudes where the atmospheric pressure is lower, and at higher temperatures under higher pressures.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Anders Celsius
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that Anders Celsius determined the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure. The response mentions Antoine Lavoisier, Henri Victor Regnault, and Joseph Black, none of whom are credited with this specific discovery according to the reference. While the response does provide some relevant information about the boiling point of water and atmospheric pressure, it does not accurately identify the correct individual as per the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
