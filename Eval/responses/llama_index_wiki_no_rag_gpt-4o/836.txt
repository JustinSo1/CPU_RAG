[PROMPT]: Why did Grant say "Damn, I had nothing to do with this batte."?
[USER_ANSWER]: Ulysses S. Grant reportedly made the remark "Damn, I had nothing to do with this battle" in reference to the Battle of Missionary Ridge during the American Civil War. This battle took place on November 25, 1863, and was a significant Union victory. 

The context behind Grant's statement is that the Union troops managed to take the ridge almost spontaneously, without direct orders from Grant. The soldiers, some of whom were led by General George Thomas, charged up the ridge in a seemingly unplanned and impulsive assault. Their unexpected success in overcoming the Confederate positions was surprising even to Grant, leading him to downplay his own role and express a mix of astonishment and humility with his remark.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: It went well.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately identifies the Battle of Missionary Ridge and provides context for Grant's statement, explaining that the Union troops took the ridge without direct orders from Grant. However, the reference answer is very brief and does not provide specific details, making it difficult to determine if the response is completely correct. The response does provide a detailed and accurate account of the event, which aligns with the historical context of Grant's remark.
[RESULT]: 4
