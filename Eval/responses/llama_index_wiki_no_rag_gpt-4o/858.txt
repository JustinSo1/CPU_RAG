[PROMPT]: Who heavily influenced the architecture and culture of Montevideo?
[USER_ANSWER]: The architecture and culture of Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, were heavily influenced by several European countries, particularly Spain and Italy. The Spanish influence is evident due to Uruguay's history as a Spanish colony, which shaped the foundational aspects of its architecture, culture, and language. Additionally, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a significant wave of Italian immigrants brought with them their architectural styles and cultural traditions, further influencing the city's development.

French and British architectural styles also left their mark on Montevideo, contributing to the city's diverse and eclectic architectural landscape. The iconic buildings, public squares, and urban layout reflect a blend of these European influences, creating a unique cultural and historical tapestry in Montevideo.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: European immigrants.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It identifies the European influence on Montevideo's architecture and culture, specifically mentioning Spain and Italy, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it goes into more detail than necessary and includes additional countries (France and Britain) that are not mentioned in the reference answer. While this extra information is not incorrect, it is not required to meet the criteria of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
