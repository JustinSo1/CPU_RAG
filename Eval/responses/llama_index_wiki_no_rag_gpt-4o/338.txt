[PROMPT]: Is it true that he shared the nobel prize in physics?
[USER_ANSWER]: To provide an accurate response, I would need to know whom you are referring to when you say "he." Many individuals have shared the Nobel Prize in Physics over the years. If you can provide the name of the person in question, I can give you more detailed information.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the need for more information to provide an accurate answer. However, it does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. The reference answer is a simple "yes," which is completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the context. The evaluated response, while logical, does not provide a definitive answer and thus does not meet the criteria for being completely correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
