[PROMPT]: Is a kangaroo on the Australian coat of arms?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, a kangaroo is featured on the Australian coat of arms. The coat of arms depicts a shield with symbols representing the six states of Australia, supported by a kangaroo on one side and an emu on the other. These two animals were chosen because they are native to Australia and are often seen as symbols of the country.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes

This additional information, while not necessary, does not detract from the accuracy of the response.
[RESULT]: 5
