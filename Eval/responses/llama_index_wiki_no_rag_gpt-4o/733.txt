[PROMPT]: Was the Bucharest Metro only opened in 1979 ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, the Bucharest Metro, which serves the capital city of Romania, was officially opened on November 16, 1979. The first line to become operational was Line M1, which initially ran between the stations Timpuri Noi and Semănătoarea (now known as Petrache Poenaru). Since then, the metro system has expanded to include multiple lines and numerous stations, serving as a critical component of the city's public transportation network.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about the Bucharest Metro's opening date, the first operational line, and its expansion. However, the instruction only asked for a confirmation of the opening year, and the reference answer is a simple "Yes." The additional details, while accurate, are not necessary to fulfill the instruction. Therefore, the response goes beyond what was required, but it does not detract from the accuracy of the information provided.
[RESULT]: 4
