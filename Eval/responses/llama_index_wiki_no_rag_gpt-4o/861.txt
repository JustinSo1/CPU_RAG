[PROMPT]: What religion do most Uruguayans profess?
[USER_ANSWER]: Most Uruguayans identify as Roman Catholic, although the country is known for its high levels of secularism compared to other Latin American nations. A significant portion of the population is non-religious or identifies as atheist or agnostic. Additionally, there are smaller communities of Protestants, Jews, and adherents of other religions.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: None.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies Roman Catholicism as the religion most Uruguayans profess. It also accurately mentions the high levels of secularism in Uruguay and the presence of non-religious individuals, atheists, agnostics, and smaller communities of other religions. However, the reference answer indicates that "None" is the most accurate response, suggesting that the most precise answer would be that no single religion is professed by most Uruguayans. Therefore, while the response provides relevant and accurate information, it does not align perfectly with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
