[PROMPT]: Does snow fall in Egypt?
[USER_ANSWER]: Snowfall in Egypt is extremely rare due to its mostly desert climate and generally warm temperatures. However, it can occasionally occur in some areas, particularly in the Sinai Peninsula and the mountainous regions. For example, Mount Catherine in the Sinai Peninsula, which is the highest mountain in Egypt, can experience snowfall during the winter months. Additionally, in recent years, there have been rare instances of light snow or sleet in parts of Cairo and other northern regions of the country during unusually cold weather patterns.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about the rarity of snowfall in Egypt and mentions specific regions where it can occur, such as the Sinai Peninsula and Mount Catherine. However, the reference answer is a simple "Yes," which directly addresses the question without additional details. While the response is informative and factually accurate, it goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer. Therefore, it does not fully align with the reference answer's directness and simplicity.
[RESULT]: 4
