[PROMPT]: Has Sang Nila Utama visited Singapore?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sang Nila Utama is a legendary figure in Singaporean history. According to the Malay Annals, a historical text, he was a Srivijayan prince from Palembang who is said to have visited the island of Temasek (the ancient name for Singapore) around the 13th century. During his visit, he is believed to have seen a creature that he thought was a lion, leading him to name the island "Singapura," which means "Lion City" in Sanskrit. While this account is part of legend and historical records from that period are limited, Sang Nila Utama is considered an important figure in the founding myth of Singapore.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate account of Sang Nila Utama's visit to Singapore, referencing historical texts and the founding myth of Singapore. However, the response is more elaborate than necessary and does not directly answer the question with a simple "yes" or "no" as the reference answer does. While the information is correct and factual, the response could be more concise to align better with the reference answer.
