[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It confirms the existence of a small heliport in Balzers, Liechtenstein, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it provides additional details about the heliport, such as its name (Balzers Heliport, LSXB), the operator (Swiss Helicopter AG), and the services offered (sightseeing flights, passenger transport, and aerial work). While these details are accurate and factual, they go beyond the simplicity of the reference answer, which only required a confirmation of the heliport's existence.
