[PROMPT]: Who took a hard line that reduced violence by groups like the Ku Klux Klan?
[USER_ANSWER]: President Ulysses S. Grant took a hard line that significantly reduced violence by groups like the Ku Klux Klan during his presidency in the early 1870s. Grant supported and enforced the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (also known as the Civil Rights Act of 1871), which allowed the federal government to intervene strongly against the Klan and other similar groups. This legislation enabled federal troops to be used to suppress Klan violence and led to the arrest and prosecution of many of its members, thereby reducing the group's activities and influence.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Grant
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies President Ulysses S. Grant as the person who took a hard line that reduced violence by groups like the Ku Klux Klan. The additional details about the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 and the federal government's actions are accurate and provide context, although they are not necessary for the answer to be correct. The reference answer is more concise, but the response still aligns with the factual information required.
[RESULT]: 4
