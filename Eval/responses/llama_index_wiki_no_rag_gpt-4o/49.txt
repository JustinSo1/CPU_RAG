[PROMPT]: Who was the first to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at the definition of an international temperature scale on scientific grounds ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The first person to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at the definition of an international temperature scale on scientific grounds was Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. In the early 18th century, Fahrenheit developed the mercury-in-glass thermometer and established the Fahrenheit temperature scale, which was one of the first standardized temperature scales used in scientific research. His work laid the foundation for subsequent developments in temperature measurement and standardization.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Anders Celsius
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that Anders Celsius was the first to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at the definition of an international temperature scale on scientific grounds, while the response incorrectly attributes this achievement to Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit.
[RESULT]: 1
