[PROMPT]: How much weight do female polar bears gain during pregnancy?
[USER_ANSWER]: Female polar bears typically gain a significant amount of weight during pregnancy, primarily to ensure they have enough energy reserves to sustain themselves and their cubs during the denning period, when they don't hunt or eat. On average, a pregnant female polar bear can gain around 200 to 400 pounds (90 to 180 kilograms), but this can vary depending on individual health, food availability, and environmental conditions. The accumulated fat reserves are crucial for the survival of both the mother and her cubs during the months they spend in the maternity den.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: They gain double their weight.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation of the weight gain in female polar bears during pregnancy, including specific figures (200 to 400 pounds) and additional context about the importance of fat reserves. However, the reference answer states that female polar bears gain double their weight, which is a more straightforward and specific answer. The response does not directly address the doubling of weight, making it somewhat correct but not fully aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
