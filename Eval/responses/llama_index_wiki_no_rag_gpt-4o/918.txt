1. **World War I**:
   - **United States Enters the War**: On April 6, 1917, the United States declared war on Germany, joining the Allies in World War I.

   - **Battles**: Several significant battles occurred in 1917, including the Battle of Vimy Ridge, the Battle of Passchendaele (Third Battle of Ypres), and the Battle of Cambrai.

2. **Russian Revolution**:
   - **February Revolution**: In March 1917 (February, according to the Julian calendar), the February Revolution led to the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, the end of the Romanov dynasty, and the establishment of a provisional government.
   - **October Revolution**: Later in the year, in November (October, according to the Julian calendar), the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the provisional government in the October Revolution. This led to the establishment of a Bolshevik government and eventually the formation of the Soviet Union.

3. **Balfour Declaration**: On November 2, 1917, the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, which expressed support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine.
