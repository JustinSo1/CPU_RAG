[PROMPT]: What is the last word on the page?
[USER_ANSWER]: I'm sorry, but I can't see the page you're referring to. Could you please provide more context or details?

This does not align with the reference answer, which is "Connecticut." Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
