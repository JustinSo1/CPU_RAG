[PROMPT]: Did Mainland Nova Scotia not come under British rule with the Treaty of Utrecht    (: ; ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule as a result of the Treaty of Utrecht, which was signed in 1713. The treaty ended the War of the Spanish Succession and resulted in France ceding several territories to Britain, including Acadia, which encompasses present-day mainland Nova Scotia, as well as parts of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no!
[FEEDBACK]: The response is factually accurate and provides detailed historical context about the Treaty of Utrecht and its implications for Mainland Nova Scotia. However, the reference answer is a simple "no," indicating that the expected response should be a straightforward negation rather than an elaborate explanation. Therefore, while the response is factually correct, it does not align with the simplicity and directness of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
