[PROMPT]: How tall were the tallest prehistoric penguins?
[USER_ANSWER]: The tallest prehistoric penguins known to date belonged to the species Palaeeudyptes klekowskii and Icadyptes salasi. These ancient penguins lived during the Eocene epoch, approximately 37 to 40 million years ago. Palaeeudyptes klekowskii is estimated to have stood about 2 meters (6.5 feet) tall and weighed around 115 kilograms (250 pounds). Icadyptes salasi was slightly shorter, standing around 1.5 meters (5 feet) tall. These impressive sizes make them some of the largest penguins ever to have lived.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1.80 meters
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides detailed information about the tallest prehistoric penguins, including their species, time period, and estimated heights. However, the reference answer specifically states that the tallest prehistoric penguins were 1.80 meters tall. The response mentions Palaeeudyptes klekowskii as being about 2 meters tall, which is not consistent with the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is mostly accurate and factual, it does not completely align with the reference answer in terms of the exact height.
[RESULT]: 4
