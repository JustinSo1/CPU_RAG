The war concluded with the Treaty of Vienna in 1738, leading to Augustus III becoming the King of Poland.

2. **First Great Awakening (1730s-1740s)**: A series of religious revivals swept through the American colonies, characterized by fervent preaching and widespread evangelical enthusiasm. Prominent figures included Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield.

4. **Scientific and Philosophical Advancements**: This period saw significant contributions to science and philosophy. For instance, Carl Linnaeus published his system of taxonomy in 1735, which laid the foundation for the classification of living organisms. In 1744, Euler's work in mathematics continued to influence the field.

5. **Cultural Developments**: The arts flourished in Europe. Baroque music was still popular, with composers like Johann Sebastian Bach producing notable works. In 1741, Handel composed the famous oratorio "Messiah."

6. **Settlement and Expansion in America**: European powers continued to explore and settle various parts of North America. The British and French vied for control over territories, leading to growing tensions that would eventually culminate in the French and Indian War.
