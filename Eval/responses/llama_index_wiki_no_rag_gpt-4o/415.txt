[USER_ANSWER]: Four years after opening his shop, James Watt began to make significant improvements to the steam engine. This took place around 1769, as he had opened his shop in 1765. Watt's enhancements led to the development of a more efficient and practical steam engine, which played a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution. His innovations included the separate condenser, which greatly improved the efficiency and power of steam engines.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Watt began to experiment with steam after his friend, Professor John Robison, called his attention to it.

The reference answer specifies that Watt began to experiment with steam after his friend, Professor John Robison, called his attention to it. The response does not mention this specific event or the involvement of Professor John Robison, making it somewhat correct but not fully accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
