[PROMPT]: Did he not determine the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure -LRB- in excellent agreement with modern data -RRB- ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, the relationship between the boiling point of water and atmospheric pressure was determined by the French scientist, Antoine Lavoisier, and later by the physicist, Blaise Pascal. They discovered that the boiling point of water decreases as the atmospheric pressure decreases, and conversely, it increases as the pressure increases. This principle is in excellent agreement with modern data and is fundamental to our understanding of how boiling points vary with altitude and pressure conditions.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes he did
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies the relationship between the boiling point of water and atmospheric pressure, and it mentions the contributions of Antoine Lavoisier and Blaise Pascal. However, the reference answer is very concise, simply confirming the determination without additional details. The response, while informative, goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer. Therefore, it does not perfectly align with the reference answer's brevity and directness.
[RESULT]: 4
