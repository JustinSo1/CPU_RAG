[PROMPT]: Is the president elected by popular vote?
[USER_ANSWER]: In the United States, the President is not elected directly by popular vote. Instead, the President is elected through a process called the Electoral College. When citizens cast their votes in a presidential election, they are actually voting for a slate of electors chosen by their party who have pledged to support the party's candidate. These electors then cast the official votes for President and Vice President.

The number of electors each state has is equal to the total number of its Senators and Representatives in Congress. There are 538 electors in total, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to win the presidency. This system means that it is possible for a candidate to win the national popular vote but lose the Electoral College and thus the presidency, as has happened in several U.S. elections.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation of the Electoral College system in the United States, which is accurate and relevant to the question. However, the reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the expected response should be concise. While the detailed explanation is informative, it goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the reference answer's simplicity.
[RESULT]: 4
