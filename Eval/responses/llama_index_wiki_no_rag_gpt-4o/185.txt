[PROMPT]: Does Egypt's foreign policy operates along moderate lines?
[USER_ANSWER]: Egypt's foreign policy has historically been characterized by a pragmatic and moderate approach, balancing its regional and international interests. Egypt often positions itself as a mediator in regional conflicts and maintains strategic partnerships with key global powers, including the United States, Russia, and European nations. It also plays an important role in the Arab League and has been involved in peace efforts, notably the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Egypt has continued to pursue a foreign policy that seeks stability and economic development. The country has worked to strengthen its ties with Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates while also maintaining relations with other regional players such as Iran and Turkey, albeit with some strategic competition and diplomatic tensions.

Egypt's foreign policy has also focused on securing its interests in the Nile River, particularly in relation to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and its impact on water resources. Egypt has sought to resolve this issue through diplomatic channels and international mediation.

Overall, while Egypt’s foreign policy is generally moderate and focused on diplomacy, it is also driven by the country’s strategic interests and regional security concerns.
