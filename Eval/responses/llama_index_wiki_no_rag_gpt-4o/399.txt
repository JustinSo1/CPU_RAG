[USER_ANSWER]: In the famous painting "Washington Crossing the Delaware" by Emanuel Leutze, the figure holding the flag is James Monroe, who would later become the fifth President of the United States. The painting, created in 1851, depicts General George Washington’s daring crossing of the Delaware River during the American Revolutionary War on the night of December 25–26, 1776. Monroe, then a young lieutenant, is shown holding the flag behind Washington in the boat.
