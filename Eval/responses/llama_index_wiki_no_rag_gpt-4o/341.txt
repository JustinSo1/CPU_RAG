[PROMPT]: Was Becquerel born in Paris into a family which, including he and his son Jean, produced four generations of scientists?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Henri Becquerel was indeed born in Paris into a distinguished family of scientists. The Becquerel family produced four generations of notable scientists, starting with Antoine CÃ©sar Becquerel, followed by his son Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel, then Henri Becquerel himself, and finally Henri's son, Jean Becquerel. This lineage contributed significantly to the fields of physics and chemistry, with Henri Becquerel being particularly renowned for his discovery of radioactivity.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately states that Henri Becquerel was born in Paris and that his family produced four generations of scientists. However, the reference answer is very brief and only confirms the information without additional details. The response provides extra context about the Becquerel family lineage, which, while informative, is not necessary to meet the criteria of the reference answer. Therefore, the response goes beyond what was required but remains accurate and factual.
[RESULT]: 4
