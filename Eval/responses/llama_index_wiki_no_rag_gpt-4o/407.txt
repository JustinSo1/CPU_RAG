[PROMPT]: Who dismantled partisan and sectional coalitions ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The dismantling of partisan and sectional coalitions in the United States can be attributed to various political leaders and movements over different periods in history. One prominent example is President Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party during the Civil War era. Lincoln's leadership and the Union's victory in the Civil War played a critical role in dismantling the sectional coalitions that had formed around the issue of slavery, particularly between the Northern and Southern states.

Another significant period was during the mid-20th century, particularly with the Civil Rights Movement. Leaders such as President Lyndon B. Johnson and Martin Luther King Jr. were instrumental in dismantling the sectional coalitions that had maintained racial segregation and discrimination, particularly in the Southern states. The passage of landmark legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 helped to break down these divisive coalitions.

In more recent times, political realignments and shifts in party platforms have also contributed to the dismantling of traditional partisan and sectional coalitions. Factors such as changing demographics, economic transformations, and evolving social attitudes have led to new political dynamics that continue to reshape the landscape of American politics.
