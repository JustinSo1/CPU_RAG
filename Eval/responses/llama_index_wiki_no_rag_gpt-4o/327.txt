[PROMPT]: Who lost control of his party to the agrarians and silverites in 1896?
[USER_ANSWER]: In 1896, President Grover Cleveland lost control of the Democratic Party to the agrarians and silverites. The silverites, who supported the free coinage of silver to increase the money supply, and the agrarians, who were largely farmers advocating for economic reforms, gained significant influence within the party. This shift was evident when the Democratic Party nominated William Jennings Bryan, a strong proponent of free silver, as their presidential candidate in the 1896 election.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Grover Cleveland
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Grover Cleveland as the person who lost control of his party to the agrarians and silverites in 1896. It provides additional context about the silverites and agrarians, and mentions the nomination of William Jennings Bryan, which is accurate and relevant to the historical context. However, the reference answer is concise and to the point, while the response includes extra information that, although accurate, is not necessary to answer the question directly. This makes the response mostly correct and accurate, but not completely aligned with the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
