[PROMPT]: How is Singapore's climate characterized?
[USER_ANSWER]: Singapore's climate is characterized as a tropical rainforest climate, which falls under the Köppen climate classification "Af". This type of climate is marked by consistently high temperatures and humidity levels throughout the year, with significant rainfall occurring year-round.

Key characteristics of Singapore's climate include:

1. **High Temperatures:** Daily temperatures typically range from 25°C (77°F) to 31°C (88°F). It is warm and humid all year round, with little variation in temperature.

2. **High Humidity:** Humidity levels are consistently high, often exceeding 80%. This can make the heat feel more intense.

3. **Frequent Rainfall:** Singapore experiences abundant rainfall, with an average annual precipitation of about 2,340 millimeters (92 inches). There is no distinct dry season, although there are slightly wetter and drier periods.

4. **Two Monsoon Seasons:** 
   - The Northeast Monsoon occurs from December to early March, bringing heavy rain and thunderstorms.
   - The Southwest Monsoon lasts from June to September, characterized by less intense but more prolonged periods of rain.

5. **Inter-Monsoon Periods:** Between the monsoon seasons, Singapore experiences inter-monsoon periods (April to May and October to November) which are marked by thunderstorms and sudden, heavy showers.

Overall, Singapore's equatorial climate results in a lush, green environment, but it also means that the weather can be quite unpredictable, with showers and thunderstorms possible at any time.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Singapore has a tropical rainforest climate with no distinctive seasons.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed and comprehensive description of Singapore's climate, including its classification as a tropical rainforest climate under the Köppen system, high temperatures, high humidity, frequent rainfall, and the presence of two monsoon seasons and inter-monsoon periods. However, the reference answer is very brief and only mentions that Singapore has a tropical rainforest climate with no distinctive seasons. While the response goes into much more detail, it does not contradict the reference answer and is factually accurate.
[RESULT]: 4
