[PROMPT]: Did lincoln have 18 months of schooling?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Abraham Lincoln had very limited formal education, amounting to approximately 18 months in total. Despite this, he was largely self-taught and became an avid reader, which allowed him to gain a broad and deep understanding of various subjects. His self-education and intellectual curiosity played a significant role in his development as a lawyer, politician, and ultimately, the 16th President of the United States.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Abraham Lincoln had approximately 18 months of formal schooling, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about Lincoln being self-taught and his intellectual curiosity, while accurate, is not necessary to answer the question directly. The response goes beyond the scope of the question, which only required a simple confirmation.
[RESULT]: 4
