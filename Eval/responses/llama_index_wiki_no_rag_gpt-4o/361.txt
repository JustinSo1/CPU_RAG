[PROMPT]: Is it true that indonesia has vast areas of wilderness?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, it is true that Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness. The country is known for its extensive rainforests, which are among the largest and most biodiverse in the world. These forests are home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, some of which are found nowhere else on Earth. In addition to rainforests, Indonesia also has large areas of mangroves, peatlands, and other natural habitats. However, these wilderness areas are under threat from deforestation, logging, agricultural expansion, and other human activities. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve these critical ecosystems.
