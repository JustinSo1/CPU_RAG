Additionally, Egypt is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the east.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Libya, Sudan, the Gaza Strip and Israel.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and accurate. It correctly identifies Libya, Sudan, and Israel as countries that border Egypt. However, it omits the Gaza Strip, which is also a bordering territory.
