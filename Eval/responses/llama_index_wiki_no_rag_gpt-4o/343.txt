[PROMPT]: Did he not die at the age of 55 in Le Croisic ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Without additional context, it's difficult to determine who you are referring to. However, if you are asking about someone specific, please provide more details such as their name or any other identifying information. This will help in giving a more accurate response.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes he died at the age of 55
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether someone died at the age of 55 in Le Croisic. Instead, it asks for more information to provide an accurate response. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of seeking clarity but does not provide the factual answer that the reference answer does. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being mostly or completely correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
