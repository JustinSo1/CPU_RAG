It correctly identifies "John of Anina" as the remains of an ancient human discovered in Romania and states that these remains are approximately 42,000 years old. However, it does not specify that the remains are specifically the lower jaw, which is a key detail in the reference answer. The response also provides additional context about the significance of the discovery, which, while informative, is not necessary for the core answer.
