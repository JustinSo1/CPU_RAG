[PROMPT]: Did one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen not pierce with a cut-out design ?
[USER_ANSWER]: It sounds like you are referencing a historical scientific experiment involving phosphorescent substances, possibly related to early research on X-rays or radiation. In such experiments, a common practice was to place various objects, such as pieces of money or metal screens with cut-out designs, between a phosphorescent screen and a source of radiation (like X-rays) to observe the effects and patterns created.

For example, when Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen discovered X-rays in 1895, he observed that these rays could pass through various materials and cast shadows or images on a fluorescent screen or photographic plate. By placing different objects between the X-ray source and the screen, he could see the varying degrees of transparency, which helped in understanding the properties of X-rays and their potential applications, especially in medical imaging.

If you have a specific experiment or context in mind, please provide more details so I can give a more precise answer.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not directly addressing the question, which is a simple yes/no question. Instead, it provides a detailed explanation about historical scientific experiments involving phosphorescent substances and X-rays. While the information provided is accurate and factual, it does not directly answer the question posed. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
