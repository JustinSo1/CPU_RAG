[PROMPT]: Did France cede nearly all of its colonies in Europe in 1763?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, France ceded nearly all of its territories in North America as a result of the Treaty of Paris in 1763. This treaty marked the end of the Seven Years' War (also known as the French and Indian War in North America). Under the terms of the treaty, France ceded Canada and all its territories east of the Mississippi River to Britain, while Spain received the territory of Louisiana. France retained a few small islands near Newfoundland and in the Caribbean but lost most of its substantial holdings in North America. This significant reshaping of colonial possessions marked a turning point in the balance of power in the region.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed information about the Treaty of Paris in 1763 and the territories France ceded as a result. However, the response does not directly address the question about France ceding nearly all of its colonies in Europe, instead focusing on North America. While the information provided is accurate, it does not fully align with the question asked.
[RESULT]: 4
