[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Theodore Roosevelt was a member of the Republican Party for most of his political career. He served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909.

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Theodore Roosevelt was a member of the Republican Party for most of his political career and provides additional context about his presidency and his run as a third-party candidate in the 1912 election. However, the reference answer is simply "Yes," which is a more direct and concise response to the question. The additional information, while accurate, is not necessary to answer the question directly.
