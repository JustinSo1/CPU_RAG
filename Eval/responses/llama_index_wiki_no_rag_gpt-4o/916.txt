[PROMPT]: Did Wilson not spend 1914 through the beginning of 1917 trying to keep America out of the war in Europe ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, President Woodrow Wilson did spend much of the period from 1914 through the beginning of 1917 trying to keep the United States out of World War I. When the war broke out in Europe in 1914, Wilson adopted a policy of neutrality, reflecting the widespread sentiment among the American public that the United States should avoid becoming entangled in the conflict. He emphasized diplomacy and peace efforts to mediate between the warring nations.

However, several events, such as the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 by a German U-boat and Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare, gradually shifted public opinion and increased pressure on the Wilson administration. Additionally, the Zimmermann Telegram, in which Germany proposed a military alliance with Mexico against the United States, further eroded the stance of neutrality. Ultimately, these factors led Wilson to ask Congress for a declaration of war against Germany, which was granted on April 6, 1917, marking the U.S. entry into World War I.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately states that President Woodrow Wilson tried to keep the United States out of World War I from 1914 through the beginning of 1917, which aligns with the reference answer. The additional details about the policy of neutrality, public sentiment, and events like the sinking of the Lusitania, unrestricted submarine warfare, and the Zimmermann Telegram are factual and provide context, but they go beyond the simplicity of the reference answer. While the extra information is accurate, it is not necessary to address the question directly.
[RESULT]: 4
