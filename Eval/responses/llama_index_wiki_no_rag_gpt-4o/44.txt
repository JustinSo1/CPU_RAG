[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: To provide an accurate answer, I would need to know the specific person you are referring to. Many authors and poets have published collections at various times, including in the year 1738. If you can provide the name of the person, I can give you more detailed information.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead asks for more information. The reference answer is a simple "No," which directly addresses the question. The evaluated response, while not incorrect, does not provide the necessary information and is not factual in the context of the specific question asked. It is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the need for more information, but it does not fulfill the requirement of providing a direct answer.
[RESULT]: 3
