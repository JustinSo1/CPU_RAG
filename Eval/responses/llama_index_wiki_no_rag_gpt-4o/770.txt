[PROMPT]: Has Urbanization eliminated many areas of former primary rainforest , with the only remaining area of primary rainforest being Bukit Timah Nature Reserve ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Urbanization has indeed led to the decline of many areas of primary rainforest globally, including in Singapore. However, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is not the only remaining area of primary rainforest in Singapore. Another significant area that still contains patches of primary rainforest is the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. 

Both Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve are crucial for the conservation of Singapore's native biodiversity and primary rainforest ecosystems. These areas have been protected to preserve their ecological value amidst the urbanization of the surrounding regions. Conservation efforts continue to be important to maintain these natural habitats.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that urbanization has led to the decline of primary rainforests and mentions Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. However, it adds information about the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, which is not mentioned in the reference answer. While this additional information is factual, it deviates from the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is not completely aligned with the reference answer but is still mostly accurate and factual.
[RESULT]: 4
