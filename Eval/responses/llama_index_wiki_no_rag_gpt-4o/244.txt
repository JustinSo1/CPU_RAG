[PROMPT]: Do women live longer than men?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, on average, women tend to live longer than men. This phenomenon is observed in many countries around the world. There are several factors that contribute to this difference in life expectancy, including biological, behavioral, and social influences.

1. **Biological factors**: Women generally have stronger immune systems and different hormonal influences that can contribute to longevity. Research suggests that estrogen, a hormone more prevalent in women, has protective cardiovascular effects.

2. **Behavioral factors**: Men are often more likely to engage in riskier behaviors such as smoking, heavy drinking, and dangerous activities. They are also less likely to seek medical advice or attend regular health check-ups.

3. **Social factors**: Women often have stronger social networks and support systems, which can contribute to better mental health and overall well-being.

While these factors help explain the general trend of women living longer than men, it is important to note that lifestyle, genetics, and access to healthcare also play significant roles in determining an individual's life expectancy.
