[PROMPT]: Where is old Ghana in relation to present Ghana?
[USER_ANSWER]: The term "Old Ghana" refers to the ancient Ghana Empire, which existed from around the 6th to the 13th century. This empire was located in what is now southeastern Mauritania and western Mali, far to the northwest of the present-day country of Ghana. Despite the name, the ancient Ghana Empire is not geographically related to the modern nation of Ghana, which is located along the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa. The modern country of Ghana adopted its name to reflect the grandeur of the ancient empire, though they are not in the same location.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 500 miles north
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate description of the location of the ancient Ghana Empire in relation to the modern country of Ghana. It correctly identifies that the ancient empire was located in what is now southeastern Mauritania and western Mali, far to the northwest of present-day Ghana. However, the reference answer is more concise and directly states the distance as "500 miles north," which is a specific and factual detail. While the response is mostly correct and factual, it does not include this specific distance detail.
[RESULT]: 4
