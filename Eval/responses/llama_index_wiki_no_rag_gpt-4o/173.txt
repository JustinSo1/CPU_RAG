[PROMPT]: Where did the expression "a sitting duck" come from?
[USER_ANSWER]: The expression "a sitting duck" is believed to have originated from hunting practices. Ducks that are sitting on the water or on the ground are easier targets for hunters compared to those that are flying. The phrase metaphorically describes someone or something that is vulnerable, defenseless, or an easy target for attack or criticism. The imagery of a duck that is not moving and is therefore more easily hit by a hunter's shot underlines the concept of being exposed to danger without the ability to escape or defend oneself. The expression has been in use since at least the early 20th century in this context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: In many areas, wild duckof various species (including ducks farmed and released into the wild) are hunted for food or sport, by shooting, or formerly by decoys.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation of the origin of the expression "a sitting duck," linking it to hunting practices and explaining the metaphorical meaning. However, the reference answer focuses on the hunting of wild ducks for food or sport, without delving into the metaphorical usage. While the response is accurate and factual in its own right, it does not align closely with the reference answer, which is more straightforward and less detailed. Therefore, the response is mostly correct and factual but not completely aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
