[PROMPT]: What happened in 1764?
[USER_ANSWER]: Several significant events occurred in 1764 across various regions. Here are a few notable ones:

1. **Pontiac's War**: This conflict between Native American tribes and the British Empire continued in 1764. The war began in 1763 as a reaction to British policies in the Great Lakes region after the French and Indian War. In 1764, the British initiated several military expeditions to quell the uprising.

2. **The Sugar Act**: In April 1764, the British Parliament passed the Sugar Act, also known as the American Revenue Act. This legislation aimed to raise revenue from the American colonies by imposing duties on imported sugar and molasses. It was one of the measures that heightened tensions leading to the American Revolution.

3. **The Currency Act**: Another piece of legislation passed by the British Parliament in 1764 was the Currency Act, which restricted the American colonies from producing their own paper money. This act was intended to protect British merchants from being paid in depreciated colonial currency.

4. **The Paxton Boys Uprising**: In early 1764, the Paxton Boys, a group of frontiersmen from Pennsylvania, marched on Philadelphia in protest against the Pennsylvania government’s lenient policies towards Native Americans. They were particularly upset by the government's failure to protect settlers from Native American raids.

5. **The Encyclopédie**: The final volumes of the Encyclopédie, edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, were published in 1764. This monumental work of the Enlightenment was a comprehensive compendium of knowledge and ideas of the time.

6. **The Jesuit Suppression in France**: In 1764, the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) was formally expelled from France by a decree issued by King Louis XV. This was part of a broader movement against the Jesuits in various European countries.

These events are just a few examples of what was happening in the world in 1764, reflecting political, social, and intellectual currents of the time.

[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed account of several significant events that occurred in 1764, including Pontiac's War, the Sugar Act, the Currency Act, the Paxton Boys Uprising, the publication of the final volumes of the Encyclopédie, and the Jesuit Suppression in France. However, the reference answer specifically mentions the marriage of Adams and Abigail Smith, which is not addressed in the response. Therefore, while the response is factually accurate regarding the events it describes, it does not align with the specific event mentioned in the reference answer.
