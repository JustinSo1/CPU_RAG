[PROMPT]: Did Grand Rapids supporters not urge him to take on Bartel J. Jonkman , the incumbent Republican congressman ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, in the 1948 election, supporters in Grand Rapids urged Gerald R. Ford to challenge the incumbent Republican congressman, Bartel J. Jonkman. Ford, a young lawyer and World War II veteran, decided to run against Jonkman in the Republican primary for Michigan's 5th congressional district. Ford successfully defeated Jonkman in the primary and went on to win the general election, beginning his long career in the U.S. House of Representatives. Ford's victory was attributed to his fresh perspective and appeal to younger voters, contrasting with Jonkman's more traditional and conservative stance.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect based on the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "No," indicating that Grand Rapids supporters did not urge him to take on Bartel J. Jonkman. However, the response provided a detailed account of an event that contradicts this, stating that supporters did urge Ford to challenge Jonkman and detailing the subsequent election. This makes the response not only incorrect but also factually inaccurate in the context of the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
