[PROMPT]: What shape are a leopard's black roS08_settes in East Africa?
[USER_ANSWER]: Leopards in East Africa, like leopards in other regions, typically have rosette-shaped spots on their fur. These rosettes are generally circular or oval in shape and can vary in size. They often have a darker outline with a lighter center, giving the appearance of a rosette or flower pattern. This unique pattern helps leopards camouflage in their natural environment.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: circular
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed description of the rosette patterns on a leopard's fur, mentioning that they are generally circular or oval in shape. However, the reference answer specifies that the rosettes are circular. While the response is mostly accurate, it introduces additional information about the shape being oval, which is not mentioned in the reference answer. This makes the response mostly correct but not completely aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
