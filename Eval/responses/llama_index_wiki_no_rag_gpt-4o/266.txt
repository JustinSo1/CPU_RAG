[USER_ANSWER]: As of my last update in October 2023, six U.S. Presidents have lived past the age of 90:

1. John Adams (1735–1826) - 2nd President, lived to be 90 years old.
2. Herbert Hoover (1874–1964) - 31st President, lived to be 90 years old.
3. Gerald Ford (1913–2006) - 38th President, lived to be 93 years old.
4. Ronald Reagan (1911–2004) - 40th President, lived to be 93 years old.

6. Jimmy Carter (born 1924) - 39th President, who has surpassed 90 years and is still living.

This list is accurate as of the latest available information.
