[PROMPT]: Why does the phrase 'elephants never forget' have no metaphorical meaning?
[USER_ANSWER]: The phrase "elephants never forget" is often used to convey the idea that elephants have excellent memories. While it is not metaphorical, it is grounded in the observation of real elephant behavior. Elephants are known for their impressive memory skills, which play a crucial role in their survival. They can remember locations of water sources, recognize other elephants they have encountered before, and recall experiences from many years past. 

The phrase is often used in a literal sense to emphasize the actual memory capabilities of elephants. However, it can also be used more generally to suggest that someone has a very good memory, though this usage is more symbolic than metaphorical. A metaphor typically involves comparing two unrelated things to highlight a particular quality, whereas "elephants never forget" is more of an idiomatic expression based on factual animal behavior.
