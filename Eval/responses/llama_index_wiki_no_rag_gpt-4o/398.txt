[PROMPT]: What was the result of the rejection of the Jay Treaty?
[USER_ANSWER]: The Jay Treaty, officially known as the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, was negotiated between the United States and Great Britain in 1794. It aimed to resolve lingering issues following the American Revolutionary War and to facilitate peaceful trade between the two nations.

When the Jay Treaty was signed and subsequently made public, it faced significant opposition within the United States for several reasons. Many Americans were unhappy that the treaty did not address the issue of British impressment of American sailors or compensate them for slaves taken during the war. Additionally, there were concerns that the treaty favored British economic interests and did not sufficiently protect American sovereignty and rights.

The result of the opposition was intense political debate. Despite the controversy, the treaty was ultimately ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1795, largely due to the efforts of President George Washington and Chief Justice John Jay, who had negotiated the treaty. Washington believed it was essential to avoid another war with Britain and maintain peace.

The ratification of the Jay Treaty had several outcomes:
1. It helped prevent a potential war between the United States and Great Britain.
2. It facilitated ten years of peaceful trade between the two nations.
3. It contributed to the emergence of distinct political parties in the U.S., with the Federalists (who supported the treaty) and the Democratic-Republicans (who opposed it) solidifying their positions.

In summary, while the Jay Treaty faced significant opposition, its ratification ultimately promoted peace and trade between the U.S. and Britain, though it also deepened political divisions within the United States.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: As a result, the two nations moved closer toward the War of 1812. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation of the Jay Treaty, its opposition, and its outcomes. However, it does not directly address the specific result mentioned in the reference answer, which is the movement toward the War of 1812. While the response is mostly correct and factual about the treaty's immediate effects, it misses the key point of the reference answer. Therefore, it is not completely accurate in the context of the given question.
[RESULT]: 3
