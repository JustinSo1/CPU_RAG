[PROMPT]: Are beetles endopterygotes?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Endopterygotes:**  This is a term for insects that undergo metamorphosis, specifically the complete metamorphosis (holometabolous) where they go through four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.  
* **Beetles:**  Beetles belong to the order Coleoptera, which is a large and diverse group of insects.  

**Therefore, beetles are definitely endopterygotes.**

Here's why:

* **Complete Metamorphosis:**  Beetles, like all holometabolous insects, undergo complete metamorphosis.
* **Larval Stage:**  Beetles have a larval stage (grub, larva, etc.) that is distinct from the adult stage.
* **Pupa Stage:**  Beetles have a pupal stage where they undergo a dramatic transformation.
