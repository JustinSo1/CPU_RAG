[PROMPT]: What do beetles eat?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Beetles are a diverse group of insects with a wide variety of diets. Here's a breakdown:

**Herbivores:**
* **Leaves:** Many beetles feed on leaves, including oak, maple, and birch. 
* **Fruits:** Some beetles, like the fruit fly, feed on fruits.
* **Flowers:** Certain beetles, like the flower beetle, feed on nectar and pollen.

**Carnivores:**
* **Insects:** Many beetles are predators, feeding on other insects like aphids, caterpillars, and grasshoppers.
* **Other invertebrates:** Some beetles also eat worms, snails, and slugs.

**Omnivores:**
* **Both plants and animals:** Some beetles, like the dung beetle, eat both plants and animals.

**Detritivores:**
* **Dead organic matter:** Some beetles, like the dung beetle, feed on decaying organic matter.

**Other:**
* **Wood:** Some beetles, like the longhorn beetle, feed on wood.
* **Sap:** Some beetles, like the bark beetle, feed on sap.

**Factors influencing diet:**
* **Species:** Different beetle species have different diets.
* **Environment:** The availability of food sources in the environment
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Some are generalists, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialised in their diet.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate breakdown of the various diets of beetles, including herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, detritivores, and other specific diets like wood and sap.
