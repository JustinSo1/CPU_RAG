[PROMPT]: How did the supporters of Henry Clay feel about Fillmore in 1848?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The supporters of Henry Clay felt **very negatively** about Millard Fillmore in 1848. 

Here's why:

* **Clay's Opposition:** Henry Clay was a prominent Whig leader who opposed the annexation of Texas and the Mexican-American War. He was also a strong advocate for a strong national government and opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories. 
* **Fillmore's Policies:** Millard Fillmore, a member of the Democratic Party, was seen as a more moderate and pro-slavery politician. He supported the annexation of Texas and the Mexican-American War, and he was generally seen as more willing to compromise on issues of slavery.
* **Political Divide:** The 1848 election was a major turning point in American politics. The Whig Party, led by Henry Clay, was in decline, and the Democratic Party, led by Millard Fillmore, was gaining strength. The two parties had very different views on slavery and the expansion of the United States.

**In short:** Clay's supporters saw Fillmore as a betrayal of their principles and a threat to the future of the nation. They felt that Fillmore's policies would lead to the expansion of slavery and weaken the national government.
