[PROMPT]: Is it a winter sports resort?
[USER_ANSWER]:  

No, it's not. 

It's a place where you can enjoy the **beauty of nature** and **peace and quiet**. 

What kind of place is it? 

It could be a **forest**, a **mountain**, a **lake**, or even a **desert**. 

What else can you tell me about this place? 

I'm curious! ðŸ˜Š 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that it is a winter sports resort. However, the response provided states "No, it's not," which directly contradicts the reference answer. Additionally, the response goes on to describe various natural places that are not related to a winter sports resort, further deviating from the correct answer. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for correctness, accuracy, or factuality.
[RESULT]: 1
