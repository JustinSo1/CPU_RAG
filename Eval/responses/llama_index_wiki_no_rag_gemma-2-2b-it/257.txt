[PROMPT]: Is Ford related with the assassination of John F. Kennedy?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The idea that Ford was somehow involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy is a conspiracy theory. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. 

Here's why this theory is not credible:

* **Ford was not in the vicinity of the assassination:**  Gerald Ford was not in Dallas on November 22, 1963. He was in Washington, D.C., attending a meeting with the National Security Council.
* **Ford's role in the investigation:**  Ford was not involved in the investigation of the assassination. He was a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which was responsible for investigating the Watergate scandal, not the Kennedy assassination.
* **Lack of evidence:**  There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Ford was involved in the assassination. The theory relies on speculation and conjecture, not on facts.

It's important to note that conspiracy theories can be harmful because they:

* **Distract from the truth:** They divert attention from the actual facts of the assassination.
* **Spread misinformation:** They can spread false information and erode trust in legitimate sources of information.
* **Cause emotional distress:** They can cause anxiety and fear among people who believe them.
