[PROMPT]: Is Canada bilingual?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Canada is officially bilingual, meaning that both English and French are recognized as official languages. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **English:** Spoken by approximately 58% of the population.
* **French:** Spoken by approximately 22% of the population.

However, it's important to note that:

* **Bilingualism is not equal:**  While English and French are official languages, the level of fluency varies widely across the country. 
* **Regional differences:**  The proportion of English and French speakers can differ significantly between provinces and regions. 
* **Not everyone speaks both languages:**  Many Canadians are bilingual in English and French, but some are only proficient in one language. 

Overall, while Canada is officially bilingual, the reality of language use is more complex and nuanced. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately states that Canada is officially bilingual and provides additional context about the distribution of English and French speakers, regional differences, and the complexity of bilingualism in Canada. However, the reference answer is a simple "Yes," which suggests that a concise response is sufficient. The evaluated response, while detailed and informative, goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
