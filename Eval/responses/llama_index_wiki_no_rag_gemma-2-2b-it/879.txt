[CORRECT_ANSWER]: (What?)
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides multiple possible answers to the question "What has many possible meanings?" and identifies "Word" as the correct answer with an explanation. However, the reference answer is simply "(What?)", which suggests a different interpretation of the question. The response is somewhat correct in identifying "Word" as having many possible meanings, but it does not align with the reference answer's approach. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct, accurate, and factual but not completely aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
