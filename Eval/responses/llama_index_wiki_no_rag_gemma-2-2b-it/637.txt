[PROMPT]: What have become flippers, useless for flight in the air?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a riddle, and the answer is **airplane wings**. 

Here's why:

* **Flippers:**  The wings of an airplane are often described as "flippers" because of their shape.
* **Useless for flight in the air:**  This is a play on words. While the wings are essential for flight, they are not used for actual "flipping" in the air.
