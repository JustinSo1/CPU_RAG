[PROMPT]: What is the name of a specialized species of duck adapted to catch large fish?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Answer:**  
**Northern Shoveler**

**Explanation:**

While the Northern Shoveler is known for its distinctive shovel-shaped bill, it's not specifically adapted for catching large fish.  The term "fish-eating duck" is often used to describe ducks like the **Mallard** or **Canvasback**, which have a more pronounced bill shape for catching fish. 

The **Northern Shoveler** is primarily a **waterfowl** species, known for its **feeding habits** on aquatic plants and invertebrates.
