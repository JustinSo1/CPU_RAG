Let me know if you have any other questions! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1905
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer states that Coolidge met and married Grace Anna Goodhue in 1905, while the response incorrectly states that both events occurred in 1910. The additional information about Coolidge and Goodhue does not compensate for the inaccuracy of the main answer.
