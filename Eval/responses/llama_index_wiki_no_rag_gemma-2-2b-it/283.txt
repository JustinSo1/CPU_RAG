[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Warm and comparatively dry
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate description of the weather at Lake Volta, including information about temperature ranges, rainy and dry seasons, humidity, and sunshine. However, the reference answer is very concise, stating that the weather is "warm and comparatively dry." While the response is mostly correct and factual, it includes more details than necessary and does not emphasize the "comparatively dry" aspect as much as the reference answer does. Therefore, it is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the reference answer's simplicity and focus.
