* **Political Stability:** Lee's government maintained a high level of political stability, preventing major social unrest and ensuring a strong national identity. This stability allowed Singapore to focus on economic development and attract foreign investment.
* **Effective Governance:** Lee's government implemented a highly centralized and efficient system of governance, with strong leadership and clear policies. This allowed for rapid decision-making and effective implementation of national plans.
* **International Recognition:** Singapore's international standing grew significantly under Lee's leadership, becoming a respected member of the international community. This was achieved through active participation in global forums and diplomatic efforts.

**Arguments against his success:**
