[PROMPT]: Do women live longer than men?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Yes, generally speaking, women tend to live longer than men. This is a well-established trend observed across many cultures and populations worldwide. 

**Here's a breakdown of the reasons behind this phenomenon:**

* **Biological Factors:**
    * **Hormonal Differences:** Women have higher levels of estrogen, which may contribute to better cardiovascular health and a lower risk of certain cancers.
    * **Genetic Predispositions:** Women may have a slightly lower risk of developing certain genetic conditions that can shorten lifespan.
    * **Cellular Aging:** Studies suggest that women may have slower cellular aging processes compared to men.
* **Lifestyle Factors:**
    * **Healthier Habits:** Women tend to have healthier lifestyles, including lower smoking rates and more physical activity.
    * **Stress Management:** Women may be better at managing stress, which can have a positive impact on longevity.
    * **Social Support:** Women often have stronger social support networks, which can contribute to better mental and physical health.
* **Socioeconomic Factors:**
    * **Access to Healthcare:** Women may have better access to healthcare, leading to earlier detection and treatment of health problems.
    * **Education and Employment:** Women often have higher levels of education and employment
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation of why women tend to live longer than men, including biological, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors. However, the reference answer is simply "Yes," which suggests that a brief and direct response is sufficient. The detailed explanation, while informative, goes beyond what is required based on the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the simplicity of the reference answer.
