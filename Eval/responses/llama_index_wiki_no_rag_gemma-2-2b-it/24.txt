[USER_ANSWER]:

Lincoln's legal career lasted for about **10 years**.

* **Later Career:** He continued practicing law until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. 

While Lincoln's legal career was relatively short compared to some other lawyers, it was a crucial period for his development as a politician and leader. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 23 years

The response does provide some context about the early and later parts of his career, but the duration mentioned is significantly off from the factual reference answer. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for being mostly correct or accurate.
