[PROMPT]: Are turtles ectothermic?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Here's why:

* **Ectothermic:** Animals that rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. 
* **Endothermic:** Animals that generate their own internal heat.

**Turtles are ectothermic.** 

Here's why:

* **They bask in the sun:** Turtles often bask in the sun to warm up their bodies.
* **They move to cooler areas:** When it's too hot, turtles will seek out cooler areas like shade or water.
* **They rely on external sources:**  Their body temperature fluctuates with the environment.
