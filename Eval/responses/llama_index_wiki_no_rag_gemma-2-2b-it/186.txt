[CORRECT_ANSWER]: June 18 1953.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a general timeframe (1952) for when Egypt became a republic, which is close but not completely accurate. The reference answer specifies the exact date as June 18, 1953. While the additional context about the 1952 revolution and subsequent events is informative, it does not correct the inaccuracy in the specific date. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but not completely accurate.
[RESULT]: 4
