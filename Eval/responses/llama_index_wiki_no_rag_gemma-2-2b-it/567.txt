[PROMPT]: Who was first apprenticed to a fuller to learn the cloth-making trade?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a tricky question!  Here's why:

* **No single "first"**:  The fulling process has been around for centuries, and the trade likely evolved gradually.  There wasn't a single person who "started it all."
* **Early evidence is limited**:  We don't have detailed records of early apprenticeships.  
* **Fulling was a widespread practice**:  Fulling was a common trade in many cultures, so it's hard to pinpoint a single origin.

**However, we can talk about the history of fulling and the likely path to becoming a fulling apprentice:**

* **Ancient origins**:  Fulling is thought to have originated in ancient civilizations like Egypt and Mesopotamia.  
* **Medieval Europe**:  Fulling became a significant trade in medieval Europe, with fullers' guilds playing a vital role in the economy.
* **Apprenticeship**:  Apprenticeships were common in medieval Europe, and fulling was no exception.  Young people would typically start by working as a laborer, learning the basics of the trade.  They would then progress to becoming an apprentice, working under the supervision of a master fuller.

**In conclusion:**  While we can
