[PROMPT]: What is one significant non-official language?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

One significant non-official language is **Esperanto**. 

Here's why:

* **Designed for global communication:** Esperanto was created in the late 19th century with the goal of being a universal language for all people. 
* **Simple grammar and vocabulary:** It has a relatively simple grammar and vocabulary, making it easier to learn than many other languages.
* **Active community:** Esperanto has a large and active community of speakers and learners worldwide.
* **Cultural impact:** Esperanto has influenced literature, art, and even politics in some circles.

While not as widely spoken as English or Mandarin, Esperanto's unique history and potential for global communication make it a significant non-official language. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Chinese.
