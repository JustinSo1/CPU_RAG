[PROMPT]: Are male otters dog-otters?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a funny question! 

Here's why it's funny:

* **It plays on the idea of "dog-like" behavior.**  Otters are playful and social animals, but they're not dogs.
* **It's a bit silly to think of otters as dogs.** Otters have different physical characteristics and behaviors.

So, no, male otters are not dog-otters. They're just otters! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that male otters are indeed referred to as dog-otters. The response provided, while humorous and engaging, ultimately denies this fact by stating, "no, male otters are not dog-otters." This contradicts the reference answer and does not align with the factual information required by the rubric.
[RESULT]: 2
