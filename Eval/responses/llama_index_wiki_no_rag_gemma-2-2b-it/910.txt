[PROMPT]: Who did Wilson win in 1917?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The question is a bit tricky because it depends on what you mean by "win." 

* **If you mean a major championship:**  Wilson did not win any major championships in 1917. 
* **If you mean a specific tournament:**  Wilson did win the **US Open** in 1917.

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Irish Americans
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided does not address the question accurately. The question asks about who Wilson won against in 1917, and the reference answer indicates "Irish Americans." The response instead discusses Wilson's achievements in terms of championships and tournaments, which is not relevant to the question. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
