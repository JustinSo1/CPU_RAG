This is a tricky question! There's no single definitive answer, as "most extensively celebrated" can be interpreted in different ways. 

Here are some contenders and why:

* **Christmas:**  With billions of people celebrating worldwide, Christmas is arguably the most widely known and celebrated holiday. It's a major cultural event with religious significance for Christians, and many non-Christians also participate in the festivities.
* **New Year's Eve:**  This holiday is celebrated globally, marking the end of the year and the beginning of a new one. It's a time for reflection, celebration, and making resolutions.
* **Diwali:**  This Hindu festival of lights is celebrated in India and other parts of the world. It's a major religious holiday with a strong cultural significance.
* **Ramadan:**  This Islamic holy month of fasting and prayer is observed by Muslims worldwide. It's a significant religious holiday with a strong cultural impact.
* **Chinese New Year:**  This festival marks the beginning of a new year on the lunisolar calendar. It's a major cultural event celebrated in many countries with a strong emphasis on family and tradition.

Ultimately, the "most extensively celebrated" holiday depends on how
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Christmas
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation of various holidays that could be considered the most extensively celebrated, including Christmas, New Year's Eve, Diwali, Ramadan, and Chinese New Year. However, the reference answer specifically identifies Christmas as the most extensively celebrated holiday. While the response acknowledges Christmas as a major contender, it does not definitively state it as the most extensively celebrated holiday, which is required for a perfect score based on the reference answer. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct and accurate but does not fully align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
