[PROMPT]: Are beetles endopterygotes with complete metamorphosis?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Endopterygotes:**  These are insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, meaning they have four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.
* **Complete Metamorphosis:** This is a type of development where the larva and adult stages are drastically different in appearance and behavior.
* **Beetles:**  Beetles are a large order of insects that belong to the class Insecta.

**Therefore, beetles are indeed endopterygotes with complete metamorphosis.**

Here's why:

* **Larvae:**  Beetles have larvae that are often called grubs or caterpillars. These larvae are specialized for feeding and growing.
* **Pupa:**  Beetles undergo a pupal stage where they transform into adults. This stage is characterized by a significant change in body structure.
* **Adults:**  Beetles have adult stages that are often winged and capable of reproduction.
