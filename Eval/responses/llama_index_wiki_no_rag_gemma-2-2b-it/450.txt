[PROMPT]: Where do joeys complete postnatal development?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **in the pouch of the mother kangaroo**. 

Here's why:

* **Specialized Pouch:** Kangaroos have a pouch, a specialized fold of skin that provides a safe and warm environment for their joeys.
* **Protection and Nourishment:** The pouch offers protection from predators and harsh weather conditions. It also provides a constant source of milk and nourishment for the developing joey.
* **Development Stages:**  The joey spends the first few months of its life in the pouch, where it continues to grow and develop. 
* **Independence:**  After a few months, the joey will start to venture out of the pouch and explore the world, but it will always return to the pouch for safety and comfort.
