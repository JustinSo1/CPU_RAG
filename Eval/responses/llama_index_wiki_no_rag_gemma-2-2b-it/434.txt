Please provide the context for your question. Who is "he"? 

Once you provide the context, I can help you with the information he recorded in his diary.

[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any information about what was recorded in the diary. Instead, it asks for additional context, which is not relevant to the task of identifying the information recorded in the diary. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
