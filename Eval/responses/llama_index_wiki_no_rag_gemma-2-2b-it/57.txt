[PROMPT]: Are beetles insects?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a bit of a trick question! 

**Yes, beetles are insects.** 

Here's why:

* **Insects are a class of animals** that share certain characteristics, including:
    * Three body segments (head, thorax, abdomen)
    * Six legs
    * Usually have wings at some point in their life cycle
    * Exoskeletons (outer covering)
* **Beetles belong to the order Coleoptera**, which is a large and diverse group of insects.

So, while beetles are a specific type of insect, they are definitely insects! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It clearly states that beetles are insects and provides detailed information to support this statement, including the characteristics of insects and the classification of beetles within the order Coleoptera. This additional information, while not necessary, does not detract from the accuracy of the response.
[RESULT]: 5
