[PROMPT]: Was Wilson , a staunch opponent of antisemitism , sympathetic to the plight of Jews , especially in Poland and in France ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This question is a bit tricky because it requires us to understand Wilson's views on antisemitism and his actions in relation to Jewish people. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know:

**Wilson's Stance on Antisemitism:**

* **He was a vocal critic of antisemitism:** Wilson condemned antisemitism in his speeches and writings, even calling it "a disease." He believed that antisemitism was a threat to American democracy and a moral wrong.
* **He was a strong advocate for Jewish rights:** Wilson supported the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and actively worked to improve the lives of Jewish people in the United States.
* **He was not a perfect champion:** While Wilson was a strong advocate for Jewish rights, he also held some views that could be considered problematic by modern standards. For example, he was a supporter of the Balfour Declaration, which promised a Jewish homeland in Palestine, but he did not always advocate for the rights of Jewish people in other countries.

**Wilson's Actions in Relation to Jewish People:**

* **He supported the creation of the League of Nations:** This organization was designed to promote international peace and cooperation, and Wilson believed that it could help to protect Jewish people from antisemitism.

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed analysis of Wilson's stance on antisemitism and his actions in relation to Jewish people. However, it does not directly answer the question of whether Wilson was sympathetic to the plight of Jews in Poland and France. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the response should have directly addressed Wilson's sympathy towards Jews in these specific countries. While the information provided is mostly accurate and factual, it does not fully align with the reference answer's directness and specificity. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but lacks the directness and specificity required.
[RESULT]: 4
