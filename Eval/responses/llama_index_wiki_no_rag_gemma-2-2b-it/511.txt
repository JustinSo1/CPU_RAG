[PROMPT]: Is the black color heritable and caused by only one recessive gene locus ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The statement that black color in humans is heritable and caused by only one recessive gene locus is **partially true**. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Heritable:** Yes, black hair color is indeed heritable. It's a trait passed down from parents to offspring.
* **Recessive gene locus:**  This is where the story gets more complex. While black hair color is influenced by a single gene, it's not a simple "one gene, one trait" situation. 
    * **The MC1R gene:** This gene plays a crucial role in melanin production, the pigment responsible for hair, skin, and eye color. Variations in the MC1R gene are responsible for different hair colors.
    * **Multiple genes involved:**  While MC1R is the primary gene, other genes also contribute to hair color variations. This means there isn't just one "black hair" gene, but rather a complex interplay of multiple genes.
    * **Recessive inheritance:**  The MC1R gene has different alleles (versions) that can influence hair color.  Some alleles are associated with black hair, while others are associated with other colors like brown or blonde.  The black hair allele is recessive
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct and accurate but not completely factual. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the black color is heritable and caused by only one recessive gene locus. The evaluated response provides a more detailed explanation, which is not entirely aligned with the simplicity of the reference answer. It correctly identifies that black hair color is heritable but complicates the explanation by discussing multiple genes and the MC1R gene's role, which deviates from the straightforward "one recessive gene locus" assertion. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but not fully aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
