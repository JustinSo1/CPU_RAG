Kangaroos are known for their powerful legs and hopping gait, but are they shy animals? The answer is a bit more complex than a simple yes or no. 

Here's a breakdown:

**Factors that influence kangaroo behavior:**

* **Species:** Different kangaroo species have different personalities and behaviors. For example, red kangaroos are generally more social and approachable than tree kangaroos.

* **Individual temperament:** Just like humans, kangaroos have individual personalities. Some kangaroos are naturally more timid than others.
* **Age:** Young kangaroos are often more playful and curious, while older kangaroos may be more cautious.

**What does "shy" mean in the context of kangaroos?**
