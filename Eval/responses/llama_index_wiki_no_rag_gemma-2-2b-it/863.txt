[PROMPT]: Can citizens propose changes to the Constitution?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **yes, but it's a complex process**.

Here's a breakdown:

**The Constitution is a living document, but it's not a democracy.**  It's a set of rules that governs the United States, and it's been amended 27 times.  

**The process for amending the Constitution is very specific and requires a supermajority vote in both houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states.**

**Here's a simplified explanation:**

1. **Proposal:**  A proposed amendment must be introduced in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. 
2. **Congressional Approval:**  A two-thirds majority vote in both houses is required to pass the amendment.
3. **Ratification:**  The amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the states. This process can take years.

**There are two main ways to propose an amendment:**

* **National Convention:**  A convention can be called by two-thirds of the state legislatures. This is less common.

**Important Considerations:**

[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation of the process for amending the Constitution, which is relevant to the question. However, it does not directly address the aspect of citizens proposing changes, which is the core of the question. The reference answer is more concise and directly answers the question by stating that people are allowed to challenge laws. The response could be improved by explicitly mentioning the role of citizens in the amendment process, such as through state legislatures or national conventions.
