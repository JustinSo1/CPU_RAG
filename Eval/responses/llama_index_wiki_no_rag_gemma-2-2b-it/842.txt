[PROMPT]: When did he vote for democrat james buchanan?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This question is incomplete. You need to provide the name of the person you are asking about. 

For example: 

"When did **Abraham Lincoln** vote for Democrat James Buchanan?" 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1856
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct, accurate, and factual answer to the question. Instead, it points out that the question is incomplete and suggests an example of how to complete it. This does not address the original question about when "he" voted for Democrat James Buchanan. The reference answer is "1856," which is not mentioned in the response. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
