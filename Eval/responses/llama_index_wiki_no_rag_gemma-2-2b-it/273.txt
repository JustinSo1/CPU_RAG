[PROMPT]: Did Grand Rapids supporters not urge him to take on Bartel J. Jonkman , the incumbent Republican congressman ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The question is a bit tricky, as it depends on what you mean by "Grand Rapids supporters." 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Grand Rapids as a City:** Grand Rapids is a city in Michigan, not a political entity in itself. It's a place where people live and vote.
* **Political Support:**  Political support can be expressed in many ways, including voting, donating to campaigns, volunteering, and attending rallies. 
* **Jonkman's Incumbency:** Bartel J. Jonkman was the incumbent Republican congressman for Michigan's 3rd congressional district. 

**So, did Grand Rapids supporters urge him to run against Jonkman?**

It's possible, but it's not clear. Here's why:

* **No Clear Evidence:** There's no readily available information indicating a specific campaign by Grand Rapids residents to urge Jonkman to run against him.
* **Focus on National Politics:**  Jonkman's campaign was primarily focused on national issues and his position within the Republican party. 
* **Local Elections:**  While Jonkman was the incumbent congressman, local elections in Grand Rapids would have involved candidates from both parties, not just Jonkman.


[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not directly addressing the question with a clear and concise answer. Instead, it provides an elaborate explanation that does not definitively answer whether Grand Rapids supporters urged him to take on Bartel J. Jonkman. The reference answer is a simple "No," which is clear and direct. The response fails to provide a definitive answer and includes speculative and irrelevant information, making it mostly incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
