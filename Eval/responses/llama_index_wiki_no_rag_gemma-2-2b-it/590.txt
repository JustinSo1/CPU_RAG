[PROMPT]: Is otter a kind of mammal?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Yes, otters are mammals. 

Here's why:

* **They nurse their young with milk:**  Otters have mammary glands, which produce milk to feed their offspring.
* **They are warm-blooded:**  Otters maintain a constant body temperature, unlike cold-blooded animals like reptiles. 
* **They have hair:**  Otters have fur, which helps them stay warm and waterproof.
