[PROMPT]: Is a polar bear at high risk of extinction?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **yes**. 

Here's why:

* **Climate Change:**  The primary threat to polar bears is climate change.  As sea ice melts, their primary hunting ground shrinks, making it harder to find seals.
* **Population Decline:**  The decline in sea ice has already led to a significant drop in polar bear populations. 
* **Conservation Efforts:**  While there are conservation efforts in place, they are not enough to prevent extinction. 
* **International Agreements:**  International agreements like the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) are in place to protect polar bears, but enforcement is a challenge.

**It's important to note:**

* The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified polar bears as "Vulnerable" to extinction.
* The situation is dire, and urgent action is needed to protect these magnificent animals.
