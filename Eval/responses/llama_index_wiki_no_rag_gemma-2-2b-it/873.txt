[PROMPT]: What does a citizen use to propose changes to the Constitution?
[USER_ANSWER]:  

A. A petition
B. A bill
C. A referendum
D. A court order

**Answer:** A. A petition

**Explanation:**

* **A petition** is a formal request signed by many people, often used to gather support for a specific cause, including proposing changes to the Constitution. 
* **A bill** is a proposed law that must be passed by Congress to become law. It's not directly used for constitutional changes.
* **A referendum** is a vote by the people on a specific issue, often used to approve or reject a proposed law. It's not the primary method for proposing constitutional changes.
* **A court order** is a legal ruling issued by a court, and while it can influence constitutional interpretation, it doesn't allow for direct changes to the document itself.
