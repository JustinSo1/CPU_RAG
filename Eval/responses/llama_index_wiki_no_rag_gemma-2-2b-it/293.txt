[PROMPT]: Do wolf pups tend to have darker fur than adults?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a tricky question because it's not a simple yes or no answer. Here's why:

* **Not always:**  While some wolf pups do have darker fur than adults, it's not a universal rule.  
* **Factors at play:**  The color of a wolf pup's fur is influenced by several factors, including:
    * **Genetics:**  Just like humans, wolves inherit genes that determine their fur color.
    * **Age:**  Pups are born with lighter fur that gradually darkens as they mature.
    * **Environment:**  The environment can also play a role, with some pups being more exposed to sunlight and thus developing darker fur.
    * **Individual variation:**  Just like humans, wolves have individual variations in their fur color.

**In short:**  While some wolf pups might have darker fur than adults, it's not a guaranteed trait. Their fur color is influenced by a combination of genetics, age, environment, and individual variation. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about the factors influencing the fur color of wolf pups, but it does not directly answer the question with a simple "yes" or "no" as the reference answer does. The response is somewhat correct in explaining that fur color can vary due to genetics, age, environment, and individual variation, but it overcomplicates the answer. The reference answer is a straightforward "yes," indicating that wolf pups do tend to have darker fur than adults, which the response does not clearly affirm. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but not fully aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
