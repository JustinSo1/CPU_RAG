[PROMPT]: Does Liechtenstein have an army?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Liechtenstein has a very small population and a strong focus on neutrality. As a result, it does not have a standing army. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Neutrality:** Liechtenstein has a long history of neutrality, meaning it doesn't take sides in international conflicts. This policy is enshrined in its constitution.
* **Defense:**  Instead of a traditional army, Liechtenstein relies on a small, professional police force and a well-trained reserve force for defense.
* **International Cooperation:**  Liechtenstein actively participates in international peacekeeping and security initiatives, demonstrating its commitment to global stability.
