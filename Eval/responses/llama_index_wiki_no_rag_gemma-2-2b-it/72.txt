[PROMPT]: Is it possible that there are more than 350,000 species of beetles?
[USER_ANSWER]:  

**Answer:**

Yes, it is possible that there are more than 350,000 species of beetles. 

**Explanation:**

* **Current Estimates:** The current estimate for the number of beetle species is around 400,000. 
* **Ongoing Discoveries:**  Scientists are constantly discovering new beetle species, especially in tropical regions. 
* **Undiscovered Diversity:** The vast majority of beetle species remain undiscovered, meaning the actual number could be significantly higher. 

**Therefore, while 350,000 is a significant number, it is likely an underestimate of the true number of beetle species.** 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It confirms that it is possible there are more than 350,000 species of beetles and provides additional context and evidence to support this claim. The explanation includes current estimates, ongoing discoveries, and the potential for undiscovered diversity, all of which are accurate and relevant to the question.
[RESULT]: 5
