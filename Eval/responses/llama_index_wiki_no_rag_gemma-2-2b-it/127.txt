[PROMPT]: What is Canada's national unemployment rate?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The national unemployment rate in Canada is **5.5%** as of October 2023. 

This information is based on the latest data released by Statistics Canada. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: While as of October 2007, Canada's national unemployment rate of 5.9% is its lowest in 33 years. Provincial unemployment rates vary from a low of 3.6% in Alberta to a high of 14.6% in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a specific unemployment rate for Canada as of October 2023, which is not mentioned in the reference answer. The reference answer provides historical data from October 2007 and includes provincial variations, which the response does not address. Therefore, the response is not aligned with the reference answer in terms of the time frame and additional details about provincial rates. The response is somewhat correct in providing a factual unemployment rate, but it does not match the reference answer's context and details.
[RESULT]: 3
