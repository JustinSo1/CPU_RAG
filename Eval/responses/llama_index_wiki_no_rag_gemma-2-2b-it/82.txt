[PROMPT]: Have coleopterists formed organisations to facilitate the study of beetles ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Answer:** Yes, there are many organizations that support coleopterists. 

Here's why:

* **Coleopterists are a dedicated group:**  Coleopterists are entomologists who specialize in the study of beetles. 
* **Organizations provide resources and networking:** These organizations offer a platform for sharing knowledge, conducting research, and connecting with other coleopterists. 
* **Examples of organizations:**
    * **The Coleopterists' Society:** This is the largest and oldest organization for coleopterists, with a focus on research, publications, and conferences.
    * **The Entomological Society of America (ESA):** While not solely focused on beetles, ESA has a large coleopterist membership and offers resources and opportunities for research.
    * **Regional and national entomology societies:** Many countries and regions have their own entomology societies that may have specific interest groups or chapters dedicated to beetles.

Let me know if you'd like to learn more about any of these organizations!

This additional information does not detract from the correctness but does add unnecessary complexity.
