[PROMPT]: Why did Grant say "Damn, I had nothing to do with this batte."?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This quote is often attributed to Ulysses S. Grant, but there's no evidence he ever said it. 

The quote is likely a fabrication, possibly stemming from a misunderstanding of Grant's personality or a humorous attempt to portray him as a reluctant soldier. 

It's important to note that Grant was a highly decorated and respected military leader, known for his strategic brilliance and unwavering determination.

[FEEDBACK]: The response provides information about the quote attributed to Ulysses S. Grant, suggesting it is likely a fabrication and explaining Grant's reputation. However, it does not directly address the question of why Grant would have said "Damn, I had nothing to do with this battle." The response is somewhat correct in discussing Grant's personality and reputation, but it does not provide a direct answer to the question. Therefore, it is not completely accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
