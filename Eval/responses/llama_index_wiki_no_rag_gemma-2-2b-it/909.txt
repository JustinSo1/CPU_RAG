[PROMPT]: What defended slavery, owned slaves and S08_set up a Sunday school for them?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **The Church of England**. 

Here's why:

* **Defended Slavery:** The Church of England, particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, was deeply involved in the slave trade. They justified it through religious arguments, claiming that Africans were "inferior" and their enslavement was a divine right.
* **Owned Slaves:** The Church of England owned slaves in its own right. This was particularly true in the Caribbean, where they held plantations and benefited from the slave trade.
* **Set up Sunday Schools:** The Church of England did establish Sunday schools, but these were often used to indoctrinate children in the Church's teachings, including the justification of slavery.

It's important to note that the Church of England's stance on slavery was complex and evolved over time. However, the institution's historical involvement in the slave trade and its use of Sunday schools to promote its views on race and slavery cannot be ignored.
