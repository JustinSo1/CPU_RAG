[CORRECT_ANSWER]: British East India Company 
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies "The British" as the entity that established a trading post on the island in 1819. However, it lacks the specificity of the reference answer, which identifies the "British East India Company" specifically. While the British were indeed responsible, the precise entity was the British East India Company, making the response slightly less accurate than the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
