[PROMPT]: How many long was Lincoln's formal education?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Answer: 
Lincoln's formal education lasted for **only 1 year**. 

**Explanation:**

Abraham Lincoln received a very limited formal education. He attended a school for only one year, and this was not a traditional school. He was primarily self-taught. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 18 months
[FEEDBACK]: The response states that Lincoln's formal education lasted for "only 1 year," which is not completely accurate based on the reference answer of 18 months. While the response does acknowledge that Lincoln had limited formal education and was primarily self-taught, the specific duration mentioned is not entirely correct. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but not fully accurate.
[RESULT]: 3
