[PROMPT]: Did Grover Cleveland support women's suffrage?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **yes**, but with some caveats.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Cleveland's stance:** Cleveland was generally supportive of women's rights and believed in equal opportunities for all citizens. He signed into law the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.
* **However:** Cleveland's support was not always consistent. He was initially hesitant to support the suffrage movement, believing it would be divisive. He also faced pressure from his political opponents who opposed women's suffrage.
* **The 1890s:** During this period, Cleveland's stance shifted. He became more supportive of women's rights and even appointed women to his cabinet.
* **The 1910s:**  Cleveland's support for women's suffrage was further solidified when he saw the growing momentum of the suffrage movement. He even campaigned for the passage of the 19th Amendment.

**In conclusion:** Grover Cleveland was a complex figure when it came to women's suffrage. He was initially hesitant but ultimately became a strong supporter of women's rights, even playing a role in the passage of the 19th Amendment. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. Grover Cleveland did not support women's suffrage, and the response contains several factual inaccuracies, such as Cleveland signing the 19th Amendment into law and appointing women to his cabinet. These events did not occur during Cleveland's presidency. The reference answer clearly states "No," indicating that Cleveland did not support women's suffrage, which contradicts the response provided.
[RESULT]: 1
