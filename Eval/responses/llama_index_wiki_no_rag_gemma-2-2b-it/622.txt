[CORRECT_ANSWER]: when penguins slide on their bellies across the snow
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided describes tobogganing as the act of sliding down a snow-covered slope on a sled or toboggan, which is a common and widely accepted definition. However, the reference answer defines tobogganing in a very specific and unconventional way, as penguins sliding on their bellies across the snow. The response does not align with this specific definition and therefore does not meet the criteria for being correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
