[PROMPT]: Did lincoln have 18 months of schooling?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a tricky question! Here's why:

* **Formal schooling wasn't the norm:**  In the 1800s, formal schooling wasn't as widespread as it is today.  Many people, including Abraham Lincoln, received their education through a combination of self-study, apprenticeships, and informal learning.
* **Lincoln's early education:** Lincoln's formal education was limited to a few years at a local school. He was a self-taught man who learned a lot through reading and observation.
* **Formal schooling later in life:** Lincoln did attend a few more years of formal schooling later in life, but these were not the typical years of schooling we think of today.

**So, did Lincoln have 18 months of schooling?**

It's impossible to say for sure.  While he did attend a few years of formal schooling, his education was a mix of formal and informal learning.  It's more accurate to say that Lincoln had a diverse and self-directed education that shaped him into the man he became. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is not directly addressing the question with a clear "yes" or "no" answer. Instead, it gives a detailed explanation about Lincoln's education, which is informative but does not directly answer the question. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should be straightforward and factual. The response to evaluate is somewhat correct in discussing Lincoln's education but fails to provide a direct and accurate answer to the question asked. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being mostly or completely correct, accurate, and factual.
