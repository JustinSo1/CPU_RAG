[PROMPT]: Does a male leopard weigh more than a female leopard?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Answer:** Yes, generally speaking, male leopards weigh more than female leopards. 

**Explanation:**

* **Size and Strength:** Male leopards are larger and heavier than females, reflecting their role in hunting and territorial defense. 
* **Hormonal Differences:**  Testosterone levels are higher in males, which contributes to their larger size and muscle mass.
* **Sexual Dimorphism:** This is a common phenomenon in many animal species where males are physically larger and more robust than females.

**Important Note:** There can be exceptions to this general rule.  The size and weight of leopards can vary depending on factors like:

* **Geographic Location:** Leopards in different regions may have different average weights.
* **Age:** Younger leopards are typically smaller than adults.
* **Individual Variation:** Just like humans, some leopards are naturally larger or smaller than others.
