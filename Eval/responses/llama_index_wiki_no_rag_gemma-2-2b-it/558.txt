[PROMPT]: Was Millard Fillmore the thirteenth President of the United States?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The correct answer is **no**. 

Millard Fillmore was the **13th** President of the United States, but he was not the 13th president. 

Here's why:

* **The 13th President of the United States was Millard Fillmore.** He served from 1850 to 1853.
* **The 13th President of the United States was Millard Fillmore.** He served from 1850 to 1853. 


Let me know if you have any other questions! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes

The response incorrectly states "no" and then contradicts itself by providing accurate information about Millard Fillmore being the 13th President. This inconsistency and the initial incorrect answer make the response completely incorrect and inaccurate.
