[PROMPT]: Has Sang Nila Utama visited Singapore?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a tricky question! 

Here's why:

* **Legend:** The story of Sang Nila Utama, the legendary founder of Singapore, is a popular one. He is said to have landed on the island in the 13th century and named it Singapura (meaning "lion city").
* **Historical Evidence:**  There is no concrete historical evidence to confirm that Sang Nila Utama actually visited Singapore. The story is passed down through generations, but it's considered a legend rather than a historical fact.
* **Singapore's History:** Singapore's history is much more complex than the legend suggests. The island was inhabited by various groups long before Sang Nila Utama's arrival. 

**So, the answer is: We don't know for sure if Sang Nila Utama visited Singapore.** 

It's a fascinating story that captures the imagination, but it's important to remember that it's a legend, not a historical fact. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation about the legend of Sang Nila Utama and the lack of concrete historical evidence regarding his visit to Singapore. However, the reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the expected response should affirm the visit without delving into the complexities or uncertainties. Therefore, while the response is informative and accurate in its own right, it does not align with the straightforward affirmation required by the reference answer. This makes the response somewhat correct but not fully aligned with the expected answer.
[RESULT]: 3
