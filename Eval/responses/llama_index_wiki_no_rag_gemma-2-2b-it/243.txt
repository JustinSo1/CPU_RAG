[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer is a simple "No," indicating that the correct answer is that a large proportion of the population does speak Swedish as its mother tongue. The response provided contradicts this by stating that Swedish is not the dominant language in Sweden, which is factually incorrect. Additionally, the response includes irrelevant information about Sweden's demographics, historical influences, and multilingualism, which does not directly address the question. The key points section is also contradictory, as it acknowledges that a significant portion of the population speaks Swedish as their first language, which aligns with the reference answer, but this is not the main message conveyed by the response.
[RESULT]: 2
