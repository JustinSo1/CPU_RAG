[PROMPT]: Have more than five Presidents lived past the age of 90?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Answer:**

Yes, there have been more than five Presidents who lived past the age of 90. 

**Explanation:**

It's important to note that this question is about the number of Presidents who lived past 90, not the number who died at 90.  

Here are some examples of Presidents who lived past 90:

* **Jimmy Carter:** 90 years old
* **Ronald Reagan:** 93 years old
* **George H.W. Bush:** 94 years old
* **Bill Clinton:** 76 years old
* **Barack Obama:** 59 years old


Let me know if you have any other questions! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer is "no," indicating that fewer than five Presidents have lived past the age of 90. The response incorrectly states that more than five Presidents have lived past the age of 90 and provides examples, some of which are not even relevant (e.g., Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who are both under 90). This demonstrates a lack of factual accuracy and correctness.
[RESULT]: 1
