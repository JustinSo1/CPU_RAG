[PROMPT]: Is Liechtenstein doubly landlocked?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Here's why it's a tricky question:

* **Technically, yes:** Liechtenstein is landlocked, meaning it's surrounded by land. It's bordered by Switzerland to the north, east, and south.
* **But, it's not a common way to describe it:**  The term "doubly landlocked" is often used to describe countries that are landlocked *and* have no direct access to the sea. 

**Liechtenstein's situation:**

* It has no direct access to the sea.
* It's completely surrounded by land.
* It's considered a "landlocked country" in the traditional sense.

**So, is it doubly landlocked?**

While technically correct, the term "doubly landlocked" isn't commonly used to describe Liechtenstein. It's more accurate to say that Liechtenstein is a landlocked country. 


Let me know if you have any other geography questions! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation but ultimately fails to directly answer the question with a simple "yes" or "no." The reference answer is a straightforward "yes," indicating that the correct response should be clear and concise. The response does mention that Liechtenstein is landlocked and discusses the concept of being "doubly landlocked," but it introduces unnecessary complexity and ambiguity. Therefore, while the response contains some correct information, it does not align with the simplicity and directness of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
