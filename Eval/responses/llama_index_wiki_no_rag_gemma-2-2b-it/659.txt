[PROMPT]: What do fossil and DNA evidence tell us?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Fossil and DNA evidence are two powerful tools that scientists use to understand the history of life on Earth. They provide insights into the evolution of species, the relationships between different organisms, and the environmental changes that have shaped life over time.

**Fossil Evidence:**

* **Preserved remains:** Fossils are the preserved remains of ancient organisms, including bones, teeth, shells, and even footprints.
* **Information about past life:** Fossils provide information about the appearance, behavior, and environment of extinct organisms.
* **Evolutionary history:** Fossils show how life has changed over time, revealing the evolution of species and the development of new traits.
* **Dating techniques:** Scientists use radiometric dating to determine the age of fossils, providing a timeline for the history of life.

**DNA Evidence:**

* **Genetic material:** DNA is the genetic material that carries the instructions for life.
* **Evolutionary relationships:** DNA sequences can be compared to determine the evolutionary relationships between different species.
* **Tracing ancestry:** DNA analysis can trace the ancestry of individuals and populations, revealing their origins and migrations.
* **Understanding disease:** DNA evidence can help us understand the origins and spread of diseases, as well as develop new treatments.

**Comparing
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The polar bear diverged from the brown bear about 200 thousand years ago.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is informative and accurate in a general sense about what fossil and DNA evidence can tell us. However, it does not address the specific information given in the reference answer, which is about the divergence of the polar bear from the brown bear approximately 200 thousand years ago. The response does not mention this specific evolutionary event or provide a direct answer to the question in the context of the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is factually correct in a broader sense, it does not align with the specific factual detail required by the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
