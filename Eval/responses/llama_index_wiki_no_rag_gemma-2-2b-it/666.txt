[PROMPT]: Do female polar bears weight more than the male?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Generally, yes.** Female polar bears are typically heavier than male polar bears. 
* **Size varies.**  There can be exceptions, and the weight difference can fluctuate depending on factors like age, diet, and location.

**Why are females heavier?**

* **Pregnancy and nursing:** Female polar bears carry and nurse cubs, which requires significant energy reserves.
* **Larger body size:** Females tend to have a larger body size than males, which contributes to their higher weight.
* **Dietary differences:**  While both sexes eat seals, females may have a slightly higher caloric intake due to their larger size and the demands of pregnancy and nursing.

**Important note:**  Polar bear populations are facing challenges due to climate change, which can impact their weight and size.
