[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Answer:**

* **Cultural Influences:**  The cultural emphasis on masculinity and physical prowess often leads to a preference for male athletes in sports. 
* **Limited Opportunities:** Women's sports in Indonesia have historically faced limited opportunities for participation, funding, and media coverage. This has contributed to a perception of sports as primarily a male domain.
