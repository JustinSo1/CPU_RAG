[PROMPT]: Did the team , sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide -LRB- laughing gas -RRB- , not remove his upper left jaw and portions of his hard palate ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

I'm not sure if this is a real event or a joke. 

Please provide more context or information. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and does not provide a clear answer. It asks for more context or information, which indicates uncertainty and does not confirm or deny the event in question. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a straightforward "yes."
[RESULT]: 1
