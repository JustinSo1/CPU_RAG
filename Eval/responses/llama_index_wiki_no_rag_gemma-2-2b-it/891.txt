[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Answer:** Yes, Woodrow Wilson was instrumental in the creation of the League of Nations.

He envisioned a world where nations would work together to maintain peace and solve disputes peacefully.

* **The Treaty of Versailles:** The Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended World War I, included the creation of the League of Nations as a key element. Wilson pushed for its inclusion, hoping it would provide a framework for international peace.
