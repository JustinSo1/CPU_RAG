[PROMPT]: Was Grover Cleveland elected Sheriff of Erie County, New York?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a trick question! Grover Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th President of the United States. He was never the Sheriff of Erie County. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that Grover Cleveland was indeed elected Sheriff of Erie County, New York. The response provided not only denies this fact but also includes irrelevant information about Grover Cleveland's presidency, which is not pertinent to the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
