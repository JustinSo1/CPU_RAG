**Yes, President Abraham Lincoln sent federal troops to Chicago in 1871.**

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. President Abraham Lincoln did not send federal troops to Chicago in 1871. The Great Chicago Fire did occur in 1871, but Lincoln was not president at that time (he was assassinated in 1865). The response contains fabricated details about Lincoln's involvement and the deployment of the 10th Cavalry Regiment, which did not happen. Therefore, the response fails to meet the criteria for accuracy and factual correctness.
[RESULT]: 1
