[CORRECT_ANSWER]: the end of the 16th century
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed account of the spread of Islam in Java and Sumatra, mentioning the gradual process starting in the 7th century and becoming dominant by the 15th century. However, the reference answer indicates that Islam became the dominant religion by the end of the 16th century. This discrepancy means the response is not completely accurate or factual based on the reference answer. The response is somewhat correct in describing the spread and factors influencing the spread of Islam, but it does not align with the specific timeframe given in the reference answer.
