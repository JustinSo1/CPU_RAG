[PROMPT]: Do penguins have a better than average sense of hearing for birds?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Yes**, penguins have a remarkably good sense of hearing. 

Here's why:

* **Specialized ear structure:** Penguins have a unique ear structure that allows them to hear sounds underwater. Their ears are positioned differently than other birds, with a larger, more sensitive outer ear that helps them detect low-frequency sounds.
* **Echolocation:** Some penguin species, like the Emperor penguin, use echolocation to navigate and find food in the dark and icy waters. They emit clicks and listen for the echoes to determine the location of prey.
* **Vocalizations:** Penguins communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, including calls, whistles, and clicks. These sounds are used for mating, territorial defense, and social interaction.

**In conclusion:** Penguins have a highly developed sense of hearing that is crucial for their survival in their harsh environment. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides detailed information about penguins' hearing abilities, including specialized ear structure, echolocation, and vocalizations. However, the reference answer is simply "yes," indicating that the correct response should be a straightforward affirmation without additional details. The response, while informative, goes beyond what is required and introduces some inaccuracies, such as the claim about echolocation, which is not a known behavior in penguins. Therefore, the response is not completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
