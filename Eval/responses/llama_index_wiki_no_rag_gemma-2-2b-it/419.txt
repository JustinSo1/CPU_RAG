[PROMPT]: Was Adams an opponent of the Stamp Act?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

No, John Adams was not an opponent of the Stamp Act. 

Here's why:

* **He was a Loyalist:**  Adams was a strong supporter of the British Crown and opposed the American Revolution. He believed in the legitimacy of the British government and its authority.
* **He served in the Continental Congress:**  While Adams was a lawyer and politician, he was not a prominent figure in the movement for independence. He served in the Continental Congress, but his role was more focused on diplomacy and maintaining relations with Britain.
* **He opposed the Sons of Liberty:** Adams was critical of the Sons of Liberty, the group that organized protests against the Stamp Act. He believed their actions were disruptive and harmful to the colonies' interests.

It's important to note that Adams' views evolved over time. He later became a key figure in the American Revolution, but his early career was marked by his loyalty to the British Crown. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. John Adams was indeed an opponent of the Stamp Act, contrary to what the response claims. The response incorrectly describes Adams as a Loyalist and misrepresents his role and views during the period leading up to the American Revolution. The reference answer clearly states that Adams was an opponent of the Stamp Act, which the response fails to acknowledge. Therefore, the response does not align with the reference answer and is not factual.
[RESULT]: 1
