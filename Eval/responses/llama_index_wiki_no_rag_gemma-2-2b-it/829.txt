[PROMPT]: Does the Order Testudines not include both extant -LRB- living -RRB- and extinct species , the earliest known turtles being from around 215 million years ago ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The Order Testudines is indeed a diverse group that includes both extant and extinct species. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Extant (Living) Species:**  The Order Testudines encompasses all living turtles, tortoises, and terrapins. This includes modern species like the sea turtle, box turtle, and painted turtle.
* **Extinct Species:**  Fossil records show a long history of turtles, with the earliest known species dating back to around 215 million years ago.  Many extinct species have been discovered, offering insights into the evolution of turtles. 

**Key Points:**

* The Order Testudines is a vast and ancient group with a rich evolutionary history.
* Both living and extinct turtles are included in the Order Testudines.
* Fossil records provide valuable information about the evolution of turtles. 


Let me know if you have any other questions about turtles! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that the Order Testudines includes both extant and extinct species and provides additional information about the evolutionary history of turtles. However, the response is more detailed than necessary and does not directly answer the question with a simple "yes" or "no," which is what the reference answer does. This additional information, while accurate, is not required to answer the question directly.
[RESULT]: 4
