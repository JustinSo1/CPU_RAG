[PROMPT]: Did Roosevelt receive a Medal of Honor?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **no**. 

Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, was a decorated military officer, but he did not receive the Medal of Honor. 

Here's why:

* **The Medal of Honor is awarded for acts of valor in combat.** Roosevelt's military service was primarily in the Rough Riders, a volunteer cavalry unit during the Spanish-American War. While he was involved in several actions, none were considered to be particularly heroic or life-threatening.
* **Roosevelt's military service was more about leadership and initiative.** He was known for his bravery and leadership, but his actions were often more strategic and tactical than those that would warrant the Medal of Honor.
* **Roosevelt's focus was on diplomacy and public service.** After his military service, he became a prominent figure in American politics and foreign policy. He was known for his progressive policies and his commitment to social justice.

While Roosevelt did not receive the Medal of Honor, he was awarded numerous other decorations for his service, including the Distinguished Service Medal and the Navy Cross.
