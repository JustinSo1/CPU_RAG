[PROMPT]: Do they prefer forested areas?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Please provide more context. What are "they"? 

For example:

* **"They" refers to a species of animal:**  "Do bears prefer forested areas?"
* **"They" refers to a group of people:** "Do they prefer forested areas for their vacation?"
* **"They" refers to something else entirely:** "Do they prefer forested areas for their business?"


Once you provide more context, I can give you a more accurate and helpful answer. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question "Do they prefer forested areas?" Instead, it asks for more context and provides examples of different interpretations of "they." While the response is thoughtful and seeks clarification, it does not provide a factual answer to the original question. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of being correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "Yes."
[RESULT]: 1
