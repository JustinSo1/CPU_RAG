[PROMPT]: Why did Coolidge not attend law school?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Calvin Coolidge, the 30th President of the United States, did not attend law school. He was a self-taught lawyer, and his legal knowledge was primarily gained through reading and experience.

Here's why he didn't go to law school:

* **He was a self-taught lawyer:** Coolidge had a strong interest in law and politics from a young age. He read extensively on legal topics and developed a deep understanding of the law through his own research and study.
* **He had a strong work ethic:** Coolidge was a hard worker and believed that learning could be achieved through dedication and effort. He was not interested in attending a traditional law school and felt that he could learn the necessary skills through practical experience.
* **He had a different path in mind:** Coolidge was more interested in politics and public service than in becoming a lawyer. He believed that he could make a greater impact on society by entering politics.

It's important to note that Coolidge's lack of formal legal education did not hinder his success in public service. He was a skilled politician and administrator, and he served as Governor of Massachusetts and Vice President before becoming President.
