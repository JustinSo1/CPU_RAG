[USER_ANSWER]: 

The Department of the Interior did not charge that the rights of way for this land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements. 

**Explanation:**

* **Public Interest:** The Department of the Interior often prioritizes the public interest when dealing with land rights. This means that the government may choose to return land to the public if it is deemed to be in the public interest.

**Historical Context:**

The Department of the Interior has been involved in numerous cases where railroads have abandoned lines, and the government has reclaimed the land. This often involves complex legal and historical considerations.
