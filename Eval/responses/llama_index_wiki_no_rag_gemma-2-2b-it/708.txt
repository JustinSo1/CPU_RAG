[PROMPT]: Is Romania a secular state?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Romania is a **constitutional republic** with a **secular state** system. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Constitutional Republic:** This means the country's government is based on a constitution, and the people have the power to choose their leaders through elections.
* **Secular State:** This means the government does not favor any particular religion and ensures the freedom of religion for all citizens. 

While Romania has a strong Catholic tradition, the constitution guarantees freedom of religion for all. This includes freedom to practice any religion, or no religion at all. 

It's important to note that while Romania is secular, there are still some religious influences in the country's culture and society.
