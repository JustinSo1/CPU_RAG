[PROMPT]: Was Ford the last surviving member of the Warren Commission ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a very complex question with a lot of nuance. Here's a breakdown of why it's difficult to answer definitively and what we know:

**Why it's difficult to answer definitively:**

* **The Warren Commission's membership:** The commission was made up of seven members, not just Ford.  
* **"Surviving" is ambiguous:**  Do we mean alive at the time of the commission's work? Or do we mean surviving in any way, even if they passed away?
* **The nature of "last surviving":**  Is it the last person alive who was on the commission, or the last person alive who was involved in the investigation?

**What we know:**

* **John F. Kennedy's assassination:** The Warren Commission was formed to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
* **Ford's role:**  Lyndon B. Johnson appointed John F. Kennedy's Attorney General, Robert Kennedy, to the Warren Commission.  Robert Kennedy was a key figure in the investigation.
* **Ford's later life:**  After the commission, Ford continued to be involved in politics and law.


**Conclusion:**

It's impossible to definitively say whether Ford
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is overly complex and does not directly answer the question. The question asks whether Ford was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission, which requires a simple factual answer. The response introduces unnecessary details and ambiguities, such as the nature of "surviving" and the roles of other members, which are not relevant to the question. Additionally, there are factual inaccuracies, such as the incorrect statement about Robert Kennedy's role. The reference answer is a straightforward "Yes," indicating that the correct response should be direct and factual. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and not factual.
[RESULT]: 2
