[USER_ANSWER]: 

Kangaroos have been a part of Australia's ecosystem for a long time, and their populations have fluctuated naturally. However, European settlement in the 18th century had a significant impact on their numbers. 

Here's a breakdown of how kangaroos have fared since European settlement:

**Negative Impacts:**

* **Habitat Loss:** Clearing land for agriculture, grazing, and urbanization has reduced kangaroo habitat.
* **Hunting:**  Kangaroos were hunted for their meat, fur, and as a source of sport.
* **Disease:** Introduced diseases like Myxomatosis have decimated kangaroo populations.
* **Competition:** Introduced predators like foxes and cats have competed with kangaroos for food and resources.

**Positive Impacts:**

* **Conservation Efforts:**  Government and conservation organizations have implemented programs to protect and manage kangaroo populations.
* **Reintroduction Programs:**  Some species have been reintroduced to areas where they were once native.
* **Adaptation:**  Kangaroos have shown remarkable adaptability, surviving in a variety of habitats and adapting to changing conditions.

**Overall:**

While kangaroos have faced significant challenges since European settlement, they have shown resilience and adaptability. Conservation efforts have helped to stabilize their populations, and some species
