[PROMPT]: Has it been created with a long term perspective to support the development of Qatar and the wider region , develop local and regional markets , and strengthen the links between the energy based economies and global financial markets ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a very broad question, and I need some more context to give you a helpful answer.  

**Please tell me:**

* **What is "it"?**  Are you referring to a specific project, policy, or initiative? 
* **What is your understanding of the long-term perspective?** What aspects of development are you interested in? 
* **What is your understanding of the links between energy-based economies and global financial markets?** 

Once I have this information, I can provide a more specific and insightful answer. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. Instead, it asks for more context and clarification, which deviates from providing a direct answer. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the expected response should be straightforward and affirmative. The evaluated response, while seeking to clarify, does not provide any factual or accurate information related to the question asked. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for correctness, accuracy, or factuality based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
