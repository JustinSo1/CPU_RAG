[PROMPT]: Who determined the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Answer:**

The dependence of the boiling point of water with atmospheric pressure was determined by **Antoine Lavoisier**. 

**Explanation:**

* **Antoine Lavoisier** was a French scientist who is considered the "father of modern chemistry". 
* He conducted experiments in the late 1700s that helped establish the relationship between pressure and the boiling point of liquids. 
* His work led to the development of the **Clausius-Clapeyron equation**, which describes the relationship between the vapor pressure of a liquid and its temperature. 

**Important Note:** While Lavoisier is credited with the initial understanding, the concept of the dependence of boiling point on pressure was further developed and refined by other scientists, including **Jacques Charles** and **Robert Boyle**. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Anders Celsius
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The correct answer is Anders Celsius, not Antoine Lavoisier. While Lavoisier made significant contributions to chemistry, he did not determine the dependence of the boiling point of water on atmospheric pressure. The explanation provided also contains inaccuracies, as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation was not developed by Lavoisier. The additional note about other scientists is irrelevant to the specific question asked.
[RESULT]: 2
