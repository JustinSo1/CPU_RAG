[PROMPT]: What was Grant's political affiliation?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Answer: Republican

**Explanation:**

While Ulysses S. Grant is often associated with the Republican Party, it's important to note that his political affiliation was complex and evolved over time. 

* **Early Career:** Grant was initially a member of the Whig Party, which was a major political force in the early 19th century. 
* **Rise to Prominence:** During the Civil War, Grant's military leadership and his role in the Union victory made him a national hero. This propelled him into the political arena.
* **Republican Party:**  He joined the Republican Party in 1868, aligning himself with its platform of Reconstruction and national unity. 
* **Later Years:**  Grant's political career continued after the war, but his views on certain issues shifted. He was criticized for his support of the "Redeemers" in the South, who sought to reassert white supremacy.

Therefore, while Grant's political affiliation was primarily with the Republican Party, his journey was marked by a complex relationship with the party and its evolving ideologies.
