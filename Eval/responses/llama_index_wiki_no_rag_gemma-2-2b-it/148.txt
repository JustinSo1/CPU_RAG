[PROMPT]: Are ducks in the Arctic Northern Hemisphere migratory?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Ducks are generally known for their migratory patterns, but the Arctic region presents a unique challenge. 

Here's a breakdown:

**Yes, ducks in the Arctic are migratory, but with some important caveats:**

* **Not all duck species are equally migratory:** Some ducks, like the Mallard, are highly migratory, spending their summers in the Arctic and winters in warmer regions. Others, like the Canvasback, are more sedentary, staying in the Arctic year-round.
* **Arctic ducks face unique challenges:** The Arctic is a harsh environment with limited food sources and harsh weather conditions. This means that ducks need to be highly adaptable and efficient in their movements.
* **Migration patterns vary:** The timing and routes of duck migration can vary depending on the species, the year, and the availability of food and water.

**Here's a more detailed look at duck migration in the Arctic:**

* **Arctic ducks rely on a combination of factors:**  They use the Earth's magnetic field, the position of the sun, and their own internal clocks to navigate.
* **Migration is essential for survival:**  Ducks need to migrate to find food and breeding grounds.
* **Climate change is impacting migration:**  Changes in temperature and
