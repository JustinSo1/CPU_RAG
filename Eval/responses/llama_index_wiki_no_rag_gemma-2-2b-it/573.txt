[PROMPT]: Is Fillmore the first of two presidents to have been an indentured servant ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Answer:**

No, Fillmore was not the first president to have been an indentured servant. 

**Explanation:**

While Millard Fillmore was born into a family of modest means and worked as a clerk before entering politics, he was not an indentured servant. 

**Here's why this is a misconception:**

* **Indentured servitude** is a legal contract where an individual works for a specific period in exchange for passage to a new land. 
* **Millard Fillmore** was a lawyer and politician who rose to prominence through his work in the New York state legislature. 

**Other presidents who were not indentured servants:**

* **George Washington**
* **John Adams**
* **Thomas Jefferson**
* **James Madison**
* **James Monroe**
* **Andrew Jackson**
* **Abraham Lincoln**


It's important to note that the term "indentured servant" is often used in a historical context, and it's possible that some individuals who worked for a period of time in exchange for passage to a new land might have been considered indentured servants. However, it's not a term that is commonly used to describe the experiences of presidents. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that Fillmore was indeed the first of two presidents to have been an indentured servant, while the response argues the opposite and provides an explanation that contradicts the reference answer. The additional information about other presidents not being indentured servants is irrelevant and does not address the instruction accurately.
[RESULT]: 1
