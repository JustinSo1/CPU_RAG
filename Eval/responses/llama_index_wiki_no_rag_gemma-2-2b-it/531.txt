[PROMPT]: What Roman province was Liechtenstein part of?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Liechtenstein was never part of a Roman province. 

Here's why:

* **Liechtenstein's History:** Liechtenstein was a small principality that emerged in the 16th century. It was never part of the Roman Empire.
* **Roman Empire:** The Roman Empire was a vast and powerful empire that existed from the 1st century BC to the 5th century AD. It controlled much of Europe and the Mediterranean.
* **Geography:** Liechtenstein is a small country in Central Europe, nestled between Switzerland and Austria. It was not geographically part of the Roman Empire's territory.

**Instead, Liechtenstein's history is intertwined with the following:**

* **The Habsburg Dynasty:** The Habsburgs were a powerful dynasty that ruled over much of Central Europe, including parts of what is now Liechtenstein.
* **The Swiss Confederacy:**  Liechtenstein became a part of the Swiss Confederacy in the 16th century. 
* **Modern Times:**  Liechtenstein became an independent principality in the 18th century. 


Let me know if you have any other questions about Liechtenstein or its history! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Raetia.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. Liechtenstein was indeed part of the Roman province of Raetia, contrary to the claim made in the response. The detailed explanation provided about Liechtenstein's history and its association with the Habsburg Dynasty and the Swiss Confederacy is irrelevant to the question asked. The response fails to address the correct historical context of Liechtenstein during the Roman Empire.
