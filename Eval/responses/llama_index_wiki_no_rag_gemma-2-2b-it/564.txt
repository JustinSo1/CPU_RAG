[PROMPT]: What did Taylor and Fillmore disagree upon?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The question of whether Taylor and Fillmore disagreed upon anything is a bit tricky.  Here's why:

* **Limited Historical Records:**  Detailed records of their private conversations and disagreements are scarce.  
* **Focus on Collaboration:**  Much of the historical focus has been on their collaborative efforts, particularly in the context of the Mexican-American War and the establishment of the Department of the Interior.
* **Different Perspectives:**  While they may not have had major disagreements, their different political philosophies and approaches to governance could have led to tensions.

**However, we can identify some areas where their views might have differed:**

* **Expansionism:**  Taylor, a strong advocate for westward expansion, might have clashed with Fillmore's more cautious approach to territorial acquisition.
* **Internal Improvements:**  Taylor's focus on infrastructure development might have differed from Fillmore's emphasis on fiscal responsibility.
* **Political Reform:**  Taylor's support for a more centralized government could have been at odds with Fillmore's belief in a more decentralized system.

**It's important to note:**

* These are potential areas of disagreement, not necessarily confirmed conflicts.
* The historical record is incomplete, making it difficult to definitively assess their disagreements.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: slavory issues
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is detailed and explores various potential areas of disagreement between Taylor and Fillmore, such as expansionism, internal improvements, and political reform. However, it does not directly address the specific issue of slavery, which is the key point mentioned in the reference answer. The response is somewhat correct in identifying possible areas of disagreement, but it misses the primary and most significant issue of slavery. Therefore, it does not fully align with the reference answer.
