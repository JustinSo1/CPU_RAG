[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Northern Europe
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Finland as being located in Northern Europe, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional details provided about Finland bordering the Baltic Sea to the east, Norway to the west, and Sweden to the south are inaccurate.
