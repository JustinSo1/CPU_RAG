Let me know if you have any other questions about Uruguay! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides additional information about the oldest church in San Carlos, Maldonado, Uruguay, which is the **Iglesia de San Carlos**. However, the instruction specifically asked for a simple confirmation (yes or no) regarding whether Uruguay's oldest church is in San Carlos, Maldonado. The response does not directly answer the question with a simple "yes" or "no," making it somewhat correct but not fully aligned with the reference answer. The additional information, while accurate, does not fulfill the requirement of the instruction.
[RESULT]: 3
