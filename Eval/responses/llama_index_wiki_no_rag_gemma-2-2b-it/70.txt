[PROMPT]: When are sperm cells transferred to the female?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Sperm cells are transferred to the female reproductive tract during **sexual intercourse**. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Ejaculation:**  During sexual intercourse, semen is ejaculated, containing millions of sperm.
* **Penetration:** The sperm travel through the vagina, cervix, and uterus, eventually reaching the fallopian tubes.
* **Fertilization:** If a sperm successfully penetrates an egg in the fallopian tube, fertilization occurs.

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: during pairing
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and accurate in describing the process of sperm transfer during sexual intercourse. However, the reference answer "during pairing" is more concise and directly addresses the question without additional details. The response provides a detailed explanation of the process, which is accurate but not necessary for the question asked. Therefore, while the response is factually correct, it is not as concise as the reference answer.
