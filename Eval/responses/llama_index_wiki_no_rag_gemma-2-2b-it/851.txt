[FEEDBACK]: The response contains several factual inaccuracies and events that did not occur in 1865. While it correctly mentions the end of the American Civil War and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, it incorrectly states that the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were ratified in 1865 (only the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865). Additionally, the completion of the first transcontinental railroad, the laying of the first transatlantic cable, the first successful commercial airplane flight, the first successful artificial heart transplant, and the development of the first successful polio vaccine did not occur in 1865. These inaccuracies significantly detract from the overall correctness and factual accuracy of the response.
