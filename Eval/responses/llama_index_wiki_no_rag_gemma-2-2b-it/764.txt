[PROMPT]: What became one of the most important commercial and military centres of the British Empire?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **Bombay**. 

Here's why:

* **Commercial Hub:** Bombay (now Mumbai) was a major port city and a crucial center for trade in the Indian Ocean. It was a key point for importing and exporting goods, particularly textiles, spices, and tea.
* **Military Importance:**  Bombay was strategically important for the British East India Company and later the British Crown. It served as a base for naval operations and a key port for troop movements.
* **Expansion of Empire:**  Bombay's location and its role in trade and military operations made it a vital center for the British Empire's expansion in India.

Bombay's significance in the British Empire is undeniable, and its legacy continues to be felt today.
