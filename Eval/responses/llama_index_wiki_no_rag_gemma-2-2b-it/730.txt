[PROMPT]: Is Romania a semi-presidential unitary state?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Romania is a **semi-presidential unitary state**. 

Here's why:

* **Unitary State:**  The power of the state is concentrated in the central government, with no regional or local governments having significant autonomy.
* **Semi-presidential:** The executive branch is headed by a president, but the president's power is limited by a prime minister and parliament. The president is elected separately from the parliament and has a significant role in the legislative process.

In Romania, the president is the head of state and has a significant role in foreign policy and national defense. The prime minister is the head of government and is responsible for day-to-day administration. The parliament is responsible for making laws and holding the government accountable.
