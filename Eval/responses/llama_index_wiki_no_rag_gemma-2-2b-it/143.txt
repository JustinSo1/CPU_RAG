[PROMPT]: Did Mainland Nova Scotia not come under British rule with the Treaty of Utrecht    (: ; ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

I'm trying to understand the history of Nova Scotia and the relationship between the British and the Acadians.

I'm confused about the Treaty of Utrecht and how it relates to the Acadians. 

Please help me understand. 

Thanks!

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no!
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and does not provide a clear answer to whether Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the Treaty of Utrecht. Instead, it expresses confusion and asks for further clarification. This does not align with the reference answer, which is a straightforward "no." Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
