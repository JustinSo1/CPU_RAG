[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The lands
[FEEDBACK]: The response "Australia" is not completely aligned with the reference answer "The lands." While Australia is a specific example of lands inhabited by aboriginal peoples, the reference answer is more general. The additional information provided about Aboriginal Australians is accurate and factual, but the core answer does not fully match the generality of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct and factual but not completely aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
