[PROMPT]: Did he not cast his ballot for John M. Palmer , the presidential candidate of the National Democratic Party , or Gold Democrats , a short-lived party that supported a gold standard , low tariffs , and limited government ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a very interesting question. It seems like you're trying to figure out who this person is and what they were voting for. 

To help me understand, could you please provide some more context? 

For example:

* **Who is "he"?**  Is this a historical figure, a person you know, or someone else?
* **When did this happen?** Knowing the time period will help narrow down the possibilities.
* **What else do you know about this person?** Any other details, like their occupation or location, would be helpful.


The more information you can give me, the better I can help you! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and instead asks for more context and information. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should be straightforward and affirmative. The response provided is neither correct nor factual based on the reference answer. It does not answer the question and instead seeks additional information, which is unnecessary in this context.
[RESULT]: 1
