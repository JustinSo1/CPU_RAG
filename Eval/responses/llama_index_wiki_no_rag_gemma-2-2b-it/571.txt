[PROMPT]: Was Another primary objective of Fillmore to preserve the Union from the intensifying slavery debate?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Answer:** Yes

**Explanation:**

James K. Polk's presidency was marked by the Mexican-American War, and the issue of slavery was a major factor in the conflict.  **James Buchanan's presidency was marked by the secession of Southern states and the Civil War.**  **Franklin Pierce's presidency was marked by the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which led to violence and instability in the territory.**  **Zachary Taylor's presidency was marked by his death, and the question of slavery's expansion was a major issue in his short term.**

**Fillmore's presidency was marked by the Compromise of 1850, which aimed to resolve the tensions surrounding slavery in the newly acquired territories.**  This was a major achievement in his term, and it helped to prevent the country from falling apart.  **The Compromise of 1850 included the Fugitive Slave Act, which required citizens to assist in the capture and return of runaway slaves.**  This act was controversial and led to further tensions between the North and South.  **The Compromise of 1850 also included the admission of California as a free state, the creation of a new territory in Utah, and the establishment of a new boundary line between Texas
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response starts with a correct and accurate answer, "Yes," which aligns with the reference answer. However, the explanation provided includes irrelevant information about other presidents and their terms, which does not directly address Fillmore's objective to preserve the Union from the intensifying slavery debate. While the mention of the Compromise of 1850 is relevant, the additional details about other presidents dilute the focus and accuracy of the response. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct and factual but not entirely focused on the instruction.
[RESULT]: 3
