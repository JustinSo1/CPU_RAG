[USER_ANSWER]: 

Yes, penguins are known to feed on krill. 

Here's why:

* **Krill are abundant:** Krill are tiny crustaceans that live in the ocean and are a major food source for many marine animals, including penguins.
* **Penguins have adapted:** Penguins have beaks and feet that are perfectly suited for catching and eating krill.
* **Krill provide essential nutrients:** Krill are rich in protein, fat, and other nutrients that penguins need to survive.

**Different penguin species have different krill-eating habits:**

* **Emperor penguins:** These penguins are known to feed on krill in the Southern Ocean.
* **Gentoo penguins:** These penguins are also known to feed on krill, particularly in the Antarctic.
* **Chinstrap penguins:** These penguins are known to feed on krill in the Southern Ocean.

**Beyond krill:**

While krill are a primary food source for many penguins, they also eat other things like fish, squid, and even small seabirds.
