[PROMPT]: Who died in childbirth in 1772?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This question is tricky because there's no widely known historical figure who died in childbirth in 1772. 

Here's why it's difficult to answer:

* **Lack of Detailed Records:**  Detailed medical records and death certificates weren't common in the 18th century. 
* **Privacy Concerns:**  Even if records existed, they might have been kept private for various reasons.
* **Focus on Other Events:**  Historical records often focus on major events and figures, leaving less attention to individual deaths.

**However, it's important to remember:**

* **Childbirth was dangerous:**  Childbirth was a major risk in the 18th century, and many women died during or after childbirth. 
* **Stories of hardship:**  While we might not have specific records, there were undoubtedly stories of women who died in childbirth during this time.
