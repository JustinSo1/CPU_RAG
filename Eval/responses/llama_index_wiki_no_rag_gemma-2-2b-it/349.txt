[PROMPT]: Is Indonesia a monarchy with a presidential system?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Indonesia is a **republic** with a **presidential system**. 

Here's why:

* **Republic:** Indonesia is not a monarchy. It is a republic, meaning the head of state is a president, not a king.
* **Presidential System:** The president is the head of state and head of government. They are elected directly by the people and have significant power in the country's political system.
