[PROMPT]: Has Urbanization eliminated many areas of former primary rainforest , with the only remaining area of primary rainforest being Bukit Timah Nature Reserve ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This statement is **false**.

Here's why:

* **Urbanization is a global issue:** While Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is a significant example of primary rainforest in Singapore, urbanization has significantly impacted many other areas of former primary rainforest globally. 
* **Deforestation is a complex issue:**  The loss of primary rainforest is driven by various factors, including:
    * **Agriculture:** Clearing land for crops and livestock.
    * **Logging:** Harvesting timber for commercial purposes.
    * **Mining:** Extracting resources from the land.
    * **Urban expansion:** Building cities and infrastructure.
* **Singapore's situation:** While Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is a protected area, Singapore has experienced significant deforestation for urban development. However, it's not the only area affected. 
* **Other examples:** Many other countries have lost vast areas of primary rainforest due to urbanization and other human activities. 

**In conclusion:** While Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is a valuable example of primary rainforest in Singapore, urbanization has impacted many other areas globally. It's crucial to understand the complex factors driving deforestation and the need for sustainable practices to protect remaining primary forests.
