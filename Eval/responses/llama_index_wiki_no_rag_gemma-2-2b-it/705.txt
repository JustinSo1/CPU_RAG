[PROMPT]: Can these allophones not occur in these positions in english?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

* **[t]** in the beginning of a word
* **[d]** in the beginning of a word
* **[ฮธ]** in the position of a vowel
* **[รฐ]** in the position of a vowel

These are allophones of the same phoneme, but they are not allowed in these positions. Why?

**Context:**

I'm working on a project about the phonology of English. I'm trying to understand the rules of English pronunciation and why certain sounds are allowed or not allowed in certain positions.

**Explanation:**

I'm trying to understand why these allophones are not allowed in these positions. I'm not sure if it's a matter of historical reasons, or if there are specific rules that govern the use of these allophones.

**Questions:**

1. Can you explain why these allophones are not allowed in these positions?
2. Are there any specific rules that govern the use of these allophones?
3. Are there any historical reasons for these restrictions?


Please provide a detailed explanation.

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided does not directly answer the question posed in the instruction. The instruction asks whether certain allophones can occur in specific positions in English, and the reference answer is a simple "yes." However, the response goes into an explanation about the positions of the allophones and asks further questions, which is not required. This makes the response mostly incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
