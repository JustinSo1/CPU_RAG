[PROMPT]: Did John Adams support the Stamp Act of 1765?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

John Adams was a strong advocate for the colonists' rights and liberties. He was a vocal critic of the Stamp Act and believed it was unconstitutional. 

Here's why:

* **He saw it as a violation of colonial rights:** Adams argued that the British Parliament had no right to impose taxes on the colonies without their consent. He believed that the colonists were British subjects and had the right to self-governance.
* **He was a strong advocate for the colonists' rights:** Adams was a founding father of the American Revolution and believed in the principles of liberty and self-government. He saw the Stamp Act as a direct attack on these principles.
* **He was a vocal critic of the Stamp Act:** Adams was one of the most vocal opponents of the Stamp Act. He wrote extensively about the Act and its implications for the colonies.

Therefore, John Adams did **not** support the Stamp Act of 1765. He actively opposed it and argued that it was unconstitutional and a violation of colonial rights.
