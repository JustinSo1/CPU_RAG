[PROMPT]: What did Cleveland die from?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Cleveland died from a **combination of factors**, including:

* **Heart disease:** This was the primary cause of death, and it was likely exacerbated by his heavy smoking and high cholesterol.
* **Stroke:** He suffered a stroke in 1999, which may have contributed to his overall health decline.
* **Complications from diabetes:** He had been diagnosed with diabetes and had experienced complications from it.

It's important to note that these are just the most likely causes, and the exact cause of death may have been a combination of these factors.

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: A heart attack
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation of multiple factors that could have contributed to Cleveland's death, including heart disease, stroke, and complications from diabetes. However, the reference answer clearly states that Cleveland died from a heart attack, which is a specific and singular cause. The response does mention heart disease as the primary cause, which is somewhat related to a heart attack, but it introduces additional factors that are not mentioned in the reference answer. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but includes inaccuracies and additional information not supported by the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
