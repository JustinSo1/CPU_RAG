[PROMPT]: What dwindled and eventually died out, starting with the Hartford Convention?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The answer is **the power of the Articles of Confederation**.

Here's why:

* **The Hartford Convention (1786):**  This meeting of delegates from the New England states was a direct response to the perceived weakness of the Articles of Confederation.

* **The Articles of Confederation:** This document, adopted in 1777, was the first governing document of the newly formed United States. It established a weak central government with limited powers, leaving most power in the hands of individual states.
* **Dwindling Power:** The Articles of Confederation proved inadequate to address national issues like debt, trade disputes, and foreign relations. This led to a sense of frustration and a desire for a stronger central government.
* **Death of the Articles:** The Hartford Convention, with its calls for a stronger central government, ultimately highlighted the limitations of the Articles. This led to the eventual adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1787, which replaced the Articles and established a stronger federal government.
