[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln sign the National Banking Act of 1863?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

No, Abraham Lincoln did not sign the National Banking Act of 1863. 

**Here's why:**

* **The National Banking Act of 1863 was signed by President Andrew Johnson.**  This act was a significant piece of legislation that established a national banking system in the United States. 
* **Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865.**  He was president during the Civil War and had a strong interest in a national banking system, but he died before the act was passed.

Let me know if you have any other questions! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes

The response also incorrectly attributes the signing of the act to President Andrew Johnson and provides incorrect information about the timeline of Lincoln's presidency and assassination.
