[PROMPT]: Did Theodore Roosevelt study Judo?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Theodore Roosevelt did not study Judo. 

While Roosevelt was a physically fit and active man, his interests and training focused on:

* **Hunting and outdoorsmanship:** He was a skilled hunter and enjoyed spending time in nature.
* **Military and physical training:** He served in the Rough Riders during the Spanish-American War and was known for his physical prowess.
* **Boxing and wrestling:** He was a skilled boxer and wrestler, and even participated in amateur competitions.

Judo, as a martial art, was not a prominent part of his training or interests. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. Theodore Roosevelt did study Judo, and the response incorrectly states that he did not. The additional information about his other interests and training is irrelevant to the question and does not compensate for the inaccuracy regarding Judo.
[RESULT]: 2
