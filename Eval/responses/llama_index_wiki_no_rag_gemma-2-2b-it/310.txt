[PROMPT]: Was Grover Cleveland born in New York?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **yes**. Grover Cleveland was born in Caldwell, New Jersey, on March 18, 1837. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The question asks if Grover Cleveland was born in New York, and the correct answer is "no." However, the response incorrectly states "yes" and provides the correct birthplace as Caldwell, New Jersey, which contradicts the initial "yes" answer. This makes the response both factually incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
