[PROMPT]: Are elephants mammals?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Yes, elephants are mammals. Here's why:

* **They give birth to live young:** Unlike reptiles or birds, elephants don't lay eggs.
* **They have mammary glands:**  These glands produce milk to nourish their young.
* **They are warm-blooded:**  Elephants can regulate their own body temperature.
* **They have hair (though it's very sparse):**  While elephants have very little hair compared to other mammals, they still have it.

Let me know if you have any other animal questions!
