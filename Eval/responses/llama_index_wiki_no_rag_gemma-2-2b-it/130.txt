[CORRECT_ANSWER]: According to 2001 census, 77.1% of Canadians identified as being Christians; of this, Catholics make up the largest group (43.6% of Canadians). The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada; about 16.5% of Canadians declare no religious affiliation, and the remaining 6.3% were affiliated with religions other than Christianity, of which the largest is Islam numbering 1.9%, followed by Judaism: 1.1%. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Christianity as the largest religious group in Canada, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the percentage provided (40%) is significantly lower than the 77.1% mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, the breakdown of other religious groups and the percentage of people with no religion are not accurate according to the reference answer. The response does mention that the numbers are estimates and can vary, but the provided figures are not close to the reference data. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but contains significant inaccuracies in the details.
[RESULT]: 3
