[CORRECT_ANSWER]: His father
[FEEDBACK]: The response "The Liberty Bell" is factually accurate in that the Liberty Bell is indeed from Pennsylvania. However, it does not match the reference answer "His father," which suggests a specific person rather than an object. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct in terms of being from Pennsylvania but does not align with the expected answer.
[RESULT]: 3
