[PROMPT]: What is the life expectancy for men in Finland?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Finland has a high life expectancy for men, with an average of **79.7 years**. 

It's important to note that this is just an average, and individual life expectancy can vary depending on factors such as:

* **Age at birth:** Men born later in the year tend to have a slightly lower life expectancy than those born earlier.
* **Socioeconomic status:** Men from higher socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have a longer life expectancy.
* **Health conditions:** Men with certain health conditions may have a shorter life expectancy.
* **Lifestyle choices:** Men who engage in healthy habits, such as regular exercise and a balanced diet, tend to have a longer life expectancy.


It's also worth noting that Finland has a strong healthcare system, which contributes to its high life expectancy.
