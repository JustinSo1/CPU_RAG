[PROMPT]: Does snow fall in Egypt?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

No, snow does not fall in Egypt. 

Egypt is located in a desert climate, and the average temperatures are too warm for snow to form. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that snow does fall in Egypt, while the response claims that it does not. The additional information about Egypt's desert climate and average temperatures being too warm for snow is also misleading, as it does not account for rare occurrences of snow in certain regions like Sinai. Therefore, the response does not align well with the reference answer and contains factual inaccuracies.
[RESULT]: 2
