[PROMPT]: How much increase in the media's contribution to GDP is the government seeking?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The question is a bit tricky because it depends on what you mean by "media's contribution to GDP." 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Direct contribution:** This refers to the revenue generated by media companies (e.g., advertising, subscriptions, ticket sales). This is a relatively straightforward measure.
* **Indirect contribution:** This includes the broader economic impact of media, such as job creation, tourism, and the value of media-related infrastructure. This is more complex to quantify.

**Government's Goals:**

The government's goals regarding the media's contribution to GDP are likely to be influenced by the specific context. 

* **Economic growth:** Governments might aim to increase the media's contribution to GDP as a way to boost overall economic growth. This could involve policies that encourage media investment, innovation, and job creation.
* **Media freedom:** Governments might also seek to ensure that the media's contribution to GDP is not hindered by restrictions on freedom of expression or access to information.
* **National security:** In some cases, governments might prioritize the media's contribution to GDP in relation to national security concerns, such as the spread of misinformation or the protection of sensitive information.

**Without more context
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The government seeks to increase its GDP contribution to 3% by 2012. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about the specific increase in the media's contribution to GDP that the government is seeking. Instead, it provides a general discussion about the potential contributions of the media to GDP and the government's possible goals. This information, while informative, does not address the specific target or percentage increase mentioned in the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and does not provide the factual information required.
[RESULT]: 2
