Let me know if you have any other questions. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: two-thirds
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the specific percentage of Liechtenstein's foreign-born population, which is the main requirement of the instruction. Instead, it gives general information about the country and the challenges in obtaining demographic data. The reference answer clearly states that two-thirds of the population is foreign-born, which is a specific and factual piece of information that the response fails to include. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not meet the criteria for accuracy and factuality based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
