[PROMPT]: Did Wilson have any siblings?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The question of whether or not Wilson had siblings is a bit tricky. 

* **No official records:** There's no readily available information about Wilson having siblings. 
* **Privacy:**  Even if he did, it's possible that personal details about his family life are kept private. 

**To find out more:**

* **Genealogy websites:** You could try searching on websites like Ancestry.com or FamilySearch.org, but be aware that access to private information is limited.
* **Local historical societies:** If you're interested in Wilson's family history, contacting local historical societies in his area of origin might be helpful. 


Let me know if you have any other questions! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question of whether Wilson had siblings. Instead, it provides a discussion about the lack of available information and suggests ways to find out more. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of addressing the difficulty in finding the information, but it does not provide a clear, factual answer as required by the rubric. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that Wilson did have siblings, which the response fails to confirm. Therefore, the response is not accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
