[PROMPT]: Did Wilson support desegregation?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Wilson's stance on desegregation was complex and evolved over time. He initially supported the idea of separate but equal, but later became more supportive of integration. 

Here's a breakdown of his position:

**Early Support for Separate But Equal:**

* **1909:** Wilson, as president of the NAACP, argued for separate but equal facilities for African Americans. This was a common position at the time, reflecting the prevailing racist ideology.
* **1910:** He wrote a letter to the NAACP arguing that "separate but equal" was the only way to ensure the rights of African Americans.

**Shifting Stance:**

* **1915:** Wilson's views began to shift as he witnessed the injustices faced by African Americans. He became increasingly critical of the "separate but equal" doctrine.
* **1919:** He joined the NAACP and became a vocal advocate for racial equality. He argued that segregation was morally wrong and that African Americans deserved equal rights.

**Later Years:**

* **1920s-1930s:** Wilson continued to advocate for racial equality and actively worked to dismantle segregation. He believed that integration was the only way to achieve true equality
