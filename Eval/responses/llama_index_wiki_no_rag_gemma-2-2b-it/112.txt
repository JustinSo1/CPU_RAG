[PROMPT]: Have there been other US presidents that have visited Cuba?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Answer:**

Yes, there have been other US presidents that have visited Cuba. 

Here are some notable examples:

* **John F. Kennedy:** Visited Cuba in 1961, during the Cuban Revolution.
* **Jimmy Carter:** Visited Cuba in 1979, during the Cold War.
* **Bill Clinton:** Visited Cuba in 1994, during the thawing of relations between the two countries.
* **George W. Bush:** Visited Cuba in 2006, during the period of increased tensions with Cuba.
* **Barack Obama:** Visited Cuba in 2016, during his presidency.

It's important to note that these visits were often controversial and politically charged, reflecting the complex history and evolving relationship between the two countries. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer clearly states "No," indicating that no other US presidents have visited Cuba. The response lists several presidents and provides specific years and contexts for their visits, which are factually incorrect. None of the listed presidents, except for Barack Obama, have visited Cuba during their presidencies. Therefore, the response does not align with the reference answer and fails to provide accurate information.
[RESULT]: 1
