[PROMPT]: These projections , called papillae , have what?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
 
 A.  A single, long, thin hair
 B.  A cluster of short, thick hairs
 C.  A single, short, blunt hair
 D.  A cluster of long, thin hairs

**Answer:** D. A cluster of long, thin hairs

**Explanation:**

Papillae are small, cone-shaped projections found on the surface of the tongue. They are covered with a cluster of long, thin hairs called **taste buds**. These taste buds contain sensory cells that detect different tastes. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: a rich blood supply
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer states that papillae have a rich blood supply, while the response incorrectly describes papillae as having a cluster of long, thin hairs and incorrectly associates taste buds with these hairs. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the anatomical structure and function of papillae.
[RESULT]: 1
