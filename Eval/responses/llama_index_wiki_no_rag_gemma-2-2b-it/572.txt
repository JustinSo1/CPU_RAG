[PROMPT]: Was Fillmore the second Chancellor, a position he maintained while both Vice President and President?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

No, that's incorrect.  

**James Buchanan** was the President of the United States during the Civil War.  

**Franklin Pierce** was the President of the United States during the Kansas-Nebraska Act. 

**Zachary Taylor** was the President of the United States during the Mexican-American War. 

**Millard Fillmore** was the **13th President of the United States**. 

**Millard Fillmore** served as **Vice President** under **President Zachary Taylor** and then as **President** after Taylor's death. 

**Millard Fillmore** was not the second Chancellor. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a lot of additional information that is not directly related to the question. While it correctly states that Millard Fillmore was not the second Chancellor, the extra details about other Presidents and Fillmore's roles as Vice President and President are unnecessary and do not directly address the question. The response is mostly correct and factual, but the additional information makes it less concise and focused than the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
