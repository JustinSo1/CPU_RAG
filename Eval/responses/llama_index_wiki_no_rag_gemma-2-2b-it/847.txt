[PROMPT]: Was Grant 's favorite brand of bourbon whiskey Old Crow ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a tricky question!  Here's why:

* **No definitive answer:** There's no official record or historical documentation stating that Ulysses S. Grant's favorite bourbon brand was Old Crow.
* **Limited information:**  While we know Grant enjoyed whiskey, the specifics of his preferences are not well-documented.
* **Popularity of Old Crow:** Old Crow was a popular brand in Grant's time, but it wasn't necessarily the most prestigious or sought-after.

**However, we can consider some factors:**

* **Availability:** Old Crow was readily available during Grant's lifetime, making it a likely choice for him.
* **Popularity:**  It was a widely consumed brand, suggesting it might have been a common choice for people of his social circle.
* **Historical context:**  Grant's era saw the rise of bourbon whiskey as a national drink, and Old Crow was a prominent player in that market.

**In conclusion:** While we can't definitively say that Old Crow was Grant's favorite, it's a plausible candidate given its popularity and availability during his time. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed analysis of the question, but it ultimately does not give a definitive answer. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should be straightforward and affirmative. The evaluated response, while informative, does not align with the reference answer's directness and certainty. It suggests that Old Crow is a plausible candidate but stops short of confirming it as Grant's favorite, which makes it somewhat correct but not fully aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
