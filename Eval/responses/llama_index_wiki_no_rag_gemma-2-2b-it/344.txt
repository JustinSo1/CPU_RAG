[PROMPT]: Did one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen not pierce with a cut-out design ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a bit of a riddle, and the answer is likely a **coin**. 

Here's why:

* **Phosphorescent substance:** This refers to a material that emits light after being exposed to light.  Think glow-in-the-dark toys or paint.
* **Paper:** This is the typical surface for a coin.
* **Metal screen:** This is a common material for coin designs.
* **Cut-out design:** This is the way coins are made, with a design on one side.

The riddle plays on the expectation of a more complex answer, leading you to think about something like a screen or a specific type of paper.
