[PROMPT]: Is it also possible that penguin comes from the Latin pinguis , fat ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Yes, that's correct!**

The word "penguin" comes from the Latin word "pinguis," which means "fat." 

This is because penguins are known for their dense, oily feathers and their large body size. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct in stating that "penguin" comes from the Latin word "pinguis," which means "fat." However, the additional explanation about penguins' dense, oily feathers and large body size is not necessary and is not part of the reference answer. The reference answer is concise and to the point, while the evaluated response includes extra information that is not required. Therefore, while the response is accurate, it is not completely aligned with the reference answer's simplicity and directness.
[RESULT]: 4
