[PROMPT]: What are approximately 42,000 years old and have been nicknamed`` John of Anina''?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **The Stonehenge monument**. 

Here's why:

* **Age:** Stonehenge is estimated to be around 5,000 years old, not 42,000. 
* **Nickname:**  The nickname "John of Anina" is a reference to a legend about a man named John who was said to have built Stonehenge. This is a myth and not based on historical evidence.

It's important to rely on accurate information when learning about historical sites. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: the remains (the lower jaw) of the oldest modern human
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The Stonehenge monument is not approximately 42,000 years old, nor is it nicknamed "John of Anina." The reference answer indicates that "John of Anina" refers to the remains (the lower jaw) of the oldest modern human, which is entirely different from the Stonehenge monument. The response does not align with the reference answer in any way and provides misleading information about Stonehenge.
[RESULT]: 1
