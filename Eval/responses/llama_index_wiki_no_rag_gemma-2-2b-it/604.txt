[PROMPT]: How do otters keep themselves warm without blubber?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Otters don't have blubber, but they have a thick layer of fur that helps them stay warm. 

Here's how it works:

* **Fur:** Otters have dense, waterproof fur that traps air close to their bodies. This air acts as insulation, keeping them warm in cold water.
* **Body Shape:** Their streamlined bodies also help them conserve heat.
* **Active Lifestyle:** Otters are active animals, which helps them generate their own body heat.
* **Social Behavior:** They huddle together for warmth, especially during cold weather.

So, while otters don't have blubber, they have other adaptations that help them stay warm in cold water. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: A layer of air trapped in their fur.
