[PROMPT]: Is the capital city Oslo?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

**Yes**, Oslo is the capital city of Norway. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies Oslo as the capital city of Norway, which is a factual statement. However, the reference answer is "no," which suggests that the expected response should have been a simple "no" rather than an elaboration. Therefore, while the response is factually accurate, it does not align with the expected simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
