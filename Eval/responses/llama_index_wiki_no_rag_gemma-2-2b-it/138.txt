[PROMPT]: What did Canada adopt in 1965?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is the **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**. 

Here's why:

* **The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms** is a fundamental document that enshrines the rights and freedoms of all Canadians. It was adopted in 1982, not 1965. 
* **The Charter** protects fundamental rights like freedom of speech, religion, and assembly, as well as the right to equality and the right to a fair trial. 

Let me know if you have any other questions!
