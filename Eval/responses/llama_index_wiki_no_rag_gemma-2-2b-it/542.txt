[PROMPT]: Is the museum collection also the national art collection of Liechtenstein ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Liechtenstein is a small country with a rich history and culture. It's known for its beautiful architecture, art, and natural beauty. 

The Liechtenstein National Museum is a great place to learn about the country's history and culture. 

The museum's collection is quite impressive, featuring a wide range of art and artifacts from different periods. 

However, I'm curious to know if the museum's collection is also the national art collection of Liechtenstein. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question asked. Instead, it provides general information about Liechtenstein and its museum, but it fails to address whether the museum collection is also the national art collection of Liechtenstein. This makes the response mostly incorrect and not factual in relation to the specific question asked.
[RESULT]: 2
