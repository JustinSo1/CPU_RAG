[PROMPT]: Is it the smallest german-speaking country in the world?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **Liechtenstein**. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response "The answer is **Liechtenstein**." is factually correct as Liechtenstein is indeed the smallest German-speaking country in the world. However, the response does not directly answer the yes/no question posed in the instruction. The reference answer "Yes" is a direct and concise response to the question. Therefore, while the response is accurate, it does not fully align with the format of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
