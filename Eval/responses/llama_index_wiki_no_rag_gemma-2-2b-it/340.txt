[PROMPT]: Was Becquerel elected Permanent Secretary of the Académie des Sciences?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

No, Becquerel was not elected Permanent Secretary of the Académie des Sciences. 

Here's why:

* **Marie Curie's Accomplishments:** Marie Curie was a physicist and chemist who made groundbreaking discoveries in radioactivity. She was a member of the Académie des Sciences and was elected as a member in 1903.
* **Henri Becquerel's Contributions:** Henri Becquerel was a physicist who discovered radioactivity. He was also a member of the Académie des Sciences.
* **Permanent Secretary:** The Permanent Secretary of the Académie des Sciences is a highly respected position, and it's not typically given to individuals who are already members. 

Let me know if you have any other questions! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer indicates that Becquerel was indeed elected Permanent Secretary of the Académie des Sciences, while the response states the opposite. Additionally, the explanation provided in the response does not directly address the question and includes irrelevant information about Marie Curie and the general role of the Permanent Secretary. This detracts from the accuracy and relevance of the response.
[RESULT]: 2
