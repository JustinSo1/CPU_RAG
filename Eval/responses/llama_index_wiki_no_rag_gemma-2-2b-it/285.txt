[PROMPT]: Is English the official language?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The official language of the United States is **English**. 

However, it's important to note that:

* **English is not the only official language in the US.**  While it's the most widely spoken and used language, there are other official languages recognized by the US government, including:
    * **Spanish**
    * **Chinese**
    * **Tagalog**
    * **Vietnamese**
    * **Arabic**
    * **Korean**
    * **Russian**
    * **French**
    * **Polish**
    * **German**
* **The US government does not have a policy of enforcing the use of any official language.** This means that while English is the most common language, people from other backgrounds are free to speak their native language.
