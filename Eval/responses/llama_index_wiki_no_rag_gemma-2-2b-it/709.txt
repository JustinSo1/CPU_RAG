[PROMPT]: Is the president elected by popular vote?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The president of the United States is elected by the ** Electoral College**, not by popular vote. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Electoral College:**  Each state has a certain number of electors based on its population. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state typically receives all of that state's electoral votes. The candidate who wins a majority of the electoral votes (at least 270 out of 538) becomes president.
* **Popular Vote:**  The popular vote is the total number of votes cast for each candidate in a specific election. 
* **Historical Context:** The Electoral College system was established in the US Constitution to balance the interests of smaller states with the interests of larger states. 

It's important to note that there have been ongoing debates about the Electoral College system, with some arguing that it is undemocratic and that the popular vote should determine the president.
