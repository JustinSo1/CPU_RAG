Let me know if you have any other history questions! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1868
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The year provided, 1861, is not the year Ulysses S. Grant was elected president. The explanation given is also irrelevant to the question about Grant's election year, as it focuses on Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War. The correct year is 1868.
