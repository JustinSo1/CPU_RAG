[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln ever represent Alton & Sangamon Railroad?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

There is no evidence that Abraham Lincoln ever represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad. 

Here's why:

* **Lincoln's Legal Career:** Lincoln's legal career was primarily focused on Illinois law, particularly in Springfield. He was a lawyer, not a railroad executive.
* **Railroad Influence:** While railroads were a significant part of the Illinois economy, Lincoln's political career was focused on broader issues like slavery and national unity.
* **Lack of Records:** There are no historical records or accounts suggesting Lincoln had any involvement with the Alton & Sangamon Railroad.

It's important to rely on credible historical sources and avoid spreading misinformation. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states that Lincoln did represent the Alton & Sangamon Railroad, while the response claims there is no evidence of such representation and provides reasons that are not aligned with historical facts. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for correctness, accuracy, or factuality.
[RESULT]: 1
