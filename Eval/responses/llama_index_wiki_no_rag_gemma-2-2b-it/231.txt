[PROMPT]: What is the life expectancy for men?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The average life expectancy for men in the United States is **73 years**. 

However, it's important to note that this is just an average. Life expectancy can vary significantly based on factors such as:

* **Race and ethnicity:**  Black men have a lower life expectancy than white men.
* **Socioeconomic status:** Men from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have shorter lifespans.
* **Health conditions:**  Men with certain health conditions, such as heart disease or cancer, may have a shorter life expectancy.
* **Lifestyle choices:**  Smoking, unhealthy diet, and lack of physical activity can all contribute to a shorter lifespan.

It's important to remember that life expectancy is just a statistic. It doesn't tell the whole story about individual health and well-being.
