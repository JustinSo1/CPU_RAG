[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Singapore has a tropical rainforest climate with no distinctive seasons.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed description of Singapore's climate, including its tropical nature, high humidity, rainy and dry seasons, monsoon winds, and microclimates. However, the reference answer indicates that Singapore has a tropical rainforest climate with no distinctive seasons. The response inaccurately describes a dry season and a distinct wet season, which contradicts the reference answer. Therefore, while the response contains some correct information about the tropical climate and high humidity, it is not completely accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
