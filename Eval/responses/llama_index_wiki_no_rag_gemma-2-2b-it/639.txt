[PROMPT]: Is it true that each penguin gets a turn in the center?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a fun question! It's a bit of a trick question. 

Here's why:

* **Penguins don't have a "center" in the way we think of it.**  They don't have a designated spot in a line or a circle. 
* **Penguins are wild animals.** They don't follow rules or have a set schedule like a game. 

So, while it's a cute idea to imagine penguins in a line or circle, it's not something that actually happens in nature. üêß 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that each penguin does get a turn in the center. However, the response provided goes into an explanation that suggests penguins do not have a center or follow a set schedule, which contradicts the reference answer. The response does not align with the factual accuracy required by the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
