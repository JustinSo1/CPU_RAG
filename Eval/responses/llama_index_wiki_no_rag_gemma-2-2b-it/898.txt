[PROMPT]: What was more damaging than moving students into colleges?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The question of whether moving students into colleges is more damaging than other factors is complex and depends on how you define "damage." 

Here are some arguments for why moving students into colleges could be considered damaging:

* **Increased cost of education:**  Moving students into colleges can increase costs for both students and institutions. This can lead to increased student debt and make higher education less accessible.
* **Loss of traditional learning environment:**  Some argue that living on campus can disrupt the traditional learning environment and lead to a decline in academic performance.
* **Increased pressure and stress:**  Living in close quarters with other students can create a more competitive and stressful environment, which can negatively impact mental health.
* **Lack of independence:**  Moving students into colleges can limit their opportunities for independence and self-reliance.

However, there are also arguments against this view:

* **Improved social and academic support:**  Living on campus can provide students with access to a wider range of social and academic support services, which can improve their overall experience.
* **Enhanced sense of community:**  Living on campus can foster a stronger sense of community and belonging among students.
* **Increased engagement in campus life:**  Living on campus can encourage students to become more involved
