[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **no**. 

Here's why:

* **Statuary in Glasgow and Edinburgh:**  While both cities have statues commemorating notable figures, there are no statues of James Watt in George Square, Glasgow, or Princes Street, Edinburgh. 
* **Other commemorations:**  While there are no statues, there are other ways to commemorate Watt's legacy in these cities:
    * **The James Watt Museum:**  Located in Glasgow, this museum houses a collection of Watt's inventions and artifacts.
    * **The James Watt Society:**  This organization promotes the study and appreciation of Watt's work.
    * **The James Watt University:**  This university in Glasgow is named in his honor.
