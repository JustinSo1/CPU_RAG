**Answer:**

Yes, that's correct. 

Here's why:

* **Large, powerful hind legs:**  Kangaroos are famous for their incredible hopping ability, powered by their strong hind legs.
* **Large feet:** Their large feet, with strong claws, provide excellent traction and stability for leaping.
* **Long muscular tail:** The tail acts as a counterbalance, helping kangaroos maintain their balance while hopping.
* **Small head:**  Kangaroos have a relatively small head compared to their body size, which helps them to conserve energy and focus on their powerful legs.
