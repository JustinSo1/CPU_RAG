[PROMPT]: What did James Monroe's letters not contain?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **his personal opinions on the subject of slavery.**

Here's why:

* **James Monroe was a key figure in the American Revolution and the early years of the United States.** He served as the fifth President of the United States and was instrumental in shaping the nation's foreign policy.
* **Monroe's letters are known for their diplomatic and political insights.** They offer a glimpse into his thinking on issues like the Louisiana Purchase, the War of 1812, and the formation of the Monroe Doctrine.
* **However, his letters rarely delve into personal opinions on slavery.** This is because he was a slave owner himself, but he also believed in the moral and political necessity of slavery's expansion.
* **Monroe's stance on slavery was complex and evolved over time.** He initially supported the institution, but later became more ambivalent. He believed in the right of states to decide on slavery, but also saw its potential to undermine national unity.

In conclusion, while James Monroe's letters offer valuable insights into his political thought, they are not a reliable source for understanding his personal views on slavery. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No letters survive in which he might have discussed his religious beliefs.

The response provides additional context and information about Monroe's political career and views on slavery, but it does not directly align with the reference answer. Therefore, it is not fully correct or accurate according to the given rubric.
