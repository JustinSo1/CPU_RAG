* **Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus)**: Found in India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.
* **Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus)**: Found in Indonesia. 

While there are two subspecies, they are considered a single species. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that there is one living species of Asian elephants, which aligns with the reference answer.
