[PROMPT]: Did Cartier not use the word ` Canada ' to refer to not only that village , but the entire area subject to Donnacona , Chief at Stadacona ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

I am trying to understand the context of Cartier's exploration and the use of the word ` Canada ' in relation to the area he explored.

Please provide any relevant information or sources that can help me understand this.

Thank you.

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. Instead, it asks for more information and context, which deviates from the straightforward "yes" provided in the reference answer. Therefore, it is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
