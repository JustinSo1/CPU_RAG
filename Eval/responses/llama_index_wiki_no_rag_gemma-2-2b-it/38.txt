[PROMPT]: Did the scientific community not reserve great attention to his theory ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The scientific community did not reserve great attention to his theory. 

Here's why:

* **"His" is ambiguous:**  The sentence is incomplete. We need to know who "he" refers to. 
* **"Great attention" is subjective:**  What constitutes "great attention" is open to interpretation. 
* **Scientific theories are complex:**  The scientific community is constantly evaluating and refining theories.  A theory may not receive immediate widespread acceptance, but it could still be influential or lead to further research.

**To improve the sentence, you need to:**

1. **Identify the person:**  Who is the "he" in the sentence?
2. **Clarify the meaning of "great attention":**  What specific actions or reactions did the scientific community show?
3. **Provide context:**  What was the theory about?  Why might it not have received immediate attention?


**Example:**

"**Albert Einstein's theory of relativity** did not receive great attention from the scientific community initially, as it challenged existing Newtonian physics." 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is not directly answering the question. The instruction asks for a simple confirmation or denial, while the response goes into an explanation and critique of the original question's phrasing. This additional information, while potentially useful, does not align with the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
