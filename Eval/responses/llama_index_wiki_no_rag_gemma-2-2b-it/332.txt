[PROMPT]: Is he buried in the Princeton Cemetery of the Nassau Presbyterian Church ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

I'm trying to find information about a man named John Henry.  I believe he was a professor at Princeton University.

I'm having trouble finding any information about him online. 

Any help would be appreciated.

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question about whether the person is buried in the Princeton Cemetery of the Nassau Presbyterian Church. Instead, it provides unrelated information about a man named John Henry and his association with Princeton University. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
