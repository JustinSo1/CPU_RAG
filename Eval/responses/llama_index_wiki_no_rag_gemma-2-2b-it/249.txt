[PROMPT]: Did ford get an award called "Congressman's congressman"?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

No, that's not a real award. 

It's a common joke or saying that plays on the idea of a powerful person being "in the pocket" of another powerful person. 

Here's why it's funny:

* **It sounds official:** The phrase "Congressman's Congressman" has a formal ring to it, making it seem like a real award.
* **It implies corruption:** The joke suggests that the person receiving the award is being rewarded for doing something that benefits the other powerful person, even if it's not in the best interests of the public. 
* **It's a bit absurd:** The idea of a company being awarded for being "in the pocket" of a politician is inherently ridiculous.
