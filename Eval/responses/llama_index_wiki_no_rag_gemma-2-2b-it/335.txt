[PROMPT]: He became chief engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways in what year?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This question is about a specific person and their career. To help me answer it, please tell me:

* **Who is the person you are asking about?** 
* **What is the approximate time period you are interested in?** (e.g., 1900s, 1950s, etc.)


Once you provide me with this information, I can help you find the answer. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: in 1894
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct year (1894) when the person became chief engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways. Instead, it asks for additional information about the person and the time period, which is not relevant to the question asked. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not address the question accurately or factually.
[RESULT]: 1
