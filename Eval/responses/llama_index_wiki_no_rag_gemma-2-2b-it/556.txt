[PROMPT]: Did Fillmore run for President a second time?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

No, Millard Fillmore did not run for President a second time. 

He served as the 13th President of the United States from 1850 to 1853. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect. The reference answer indicates that Fillmore did run for President a second time, while the response states that he did not. Additionally, the extra information about his term as the 13th President does not address the question and is irrelevant to the accuracy of the response. Therefore, the response is not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
