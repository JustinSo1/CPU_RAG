[PROMPT]: Did Horace Greenley lose in the presidential elections of 1872?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The question of whether Horace Greenley lost the 1872 presidential election is a bit tricky. Here's why:

* **Horace Greenley was not a presidential candidate.**  There was no presidential candidate named Horace Greenley in 1872. 
* **The 1872 presidential election was between Ulysses S. Grant (Republican) and Samuel J. Tilden (Democrat).** 

It's possible you're thinking of a different person or election. 

Let me know if you have any other questions! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. Horace Greeley (note the correct spelling) was indeed a presidential candidate in the 1872 election, running against Ulysses S. Grant. The response incorrectly states that there was no candidate named Horace Greenley and incorrectly identifies Samuel J. Tilden as Grant's opponent in 1872 (Tilden ran in 1876). The response fails to address the question accurately and provides misleading information.
[RESULT]: 1
