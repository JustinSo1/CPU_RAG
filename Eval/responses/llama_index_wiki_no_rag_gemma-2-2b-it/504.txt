[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual in explaining that leopards are not circular. However, it goes into unnecessary detail and does not directly answer the question as succinctly as the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "No," which is completely correct and factual. The evaluated response, while accurate, is more elaborate than needed for this particular question.
