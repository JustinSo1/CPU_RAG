B.  The United States
C.  The Roman Catholic Church
D.  The Presbyterian Church

**Answer:** A. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

**Explanation:**

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) experienced rapid growth in the mid-19th century, reaching a community of 100,000 by 1869. This was largely due to the efforts of Brigham Young, who led the Mormons westward to Utah. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: British India office
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is completely incorrect and does not match the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that the British India office boasted a sizeable community of 100,000 by 1869, whereas the response incorrectly identifies The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The explanation given, while detailed, does not align with the correct answer and is therefore not factual in this context.
