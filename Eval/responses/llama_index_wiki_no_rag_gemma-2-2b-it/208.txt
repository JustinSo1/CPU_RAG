[PROMPT]: What are the elephant's ears important for?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The elephant's ears are important for a variety of reasons, including:

* **Temperature Regulation:** Elephants are large animals and can generate a lot of heat. Their ears are a large surface area that helps them to dissipate heat through radiation.
* **Communication:** Elephants use their ears to communicate with each other. They can raise their ears to signal their mood or intentions.
* **Hearing:** The ears are also important for hearing. They help to amplify sound waves and direct them to the inner ear.
