* **Land ownership:**  The vast majority of land in the prairies was held by the Crown, and many immigrants were unable to secure land ownership.

* **Farming:** Some European immigrants, particularly those from Germany and Scandinavia, were skilled farmers and brought their knowledge and experience to the prairies. They helped develop farming techniques and practices that were adapted to the unique conditions of the land.
