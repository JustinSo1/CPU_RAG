[PROMPT]: Who dismantled partisan and sectional coalitions ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The answer is **Abraham Lincoln**. 

Here's why:

* **The Civil War:** Lincoln's presidency was defined by the Civil War, a conflict that pitted the Union (North) against the Confederacy (South). 
* **Sectionalism and Partisanship:**  The war was fueled by deep-seated sectionalism and partisan divisions between the North and South. The South's desire to maintain slavery and the North's growing opposition to it created a volatile political climate.
* **Lincoln's Leadership:** Lincoln skillfully navigated these divisions, appealing to both sides while ultimately seeking to preserve the Union. He issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared slaves in Confederate territories free, and led the Union to victory.
* **Dismantling Coalitions:** Lincoln's actions effectively dismantled the existing coalitions that had fueled the conflict. He challenged the South's economic and political power, weakened the Confederacy's military, and ultimately forced the South to surrender.

**In summary:** Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War was instrumental in dismantling the partisan and sectional coalitions that had divided the nation. His actions ultimately led to the preservation of the Union and the end of slavery. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: many congressmen
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that "many congressmen" dismantled partisan and sectional coalitions, while the response attributes this action to Abraham Lincoln. The detailed explanation provided about Lincoln's role during the Civil War does not align with the reference answer, which focuses on the collective efforts of congressmen rather than a single individual. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate.
[RESULT]: 2
