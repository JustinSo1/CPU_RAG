[PROMPT]: Is a Kangaroo a Marsupial?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Yes, a kangaroo is a marsupial. 

Here's why:

* **Marsupials** are mammals that carry their young in a pouch. 
* **Kangaroos** are a type of marsupial, specifically a **diprotodontid**. 
* This means they have a pouch where their young, called joeys, develop after birth.

Let me know if you have any other animal questions! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that a kangaroo is a marsupial and provides additional accurate information about marsupials and kangaroos, such as the fact that marsupials carry their young in a pouch and that kangaroos are a type of diprotodontid. This additional information, while not necessary, does not detract from the accuracy of the response.
[RESULT]: 5
