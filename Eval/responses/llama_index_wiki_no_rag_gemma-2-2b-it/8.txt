[PROMPT]: When did the Gettysburg address argue that America was born?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The Gettysburg Address did not argue that America was born. It argued that America was **founded**. 

Here's why:

* **The Gettysburg Address was delivered on November 19, 1863, at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.**  It was a speech given to honor the Union soldiers who died at the Battle of Gettysburg.
* **The speech focused on the principles of equality and unity that the nation was founded upon.**  Abraham Lincoln emphasized the importance of preserving the Union and the ideals of liberty and self-government.
* **The Gettysburg Address did not mention the date of the Declaration of Independence.**  It was a speech about the ongoing struggle for freedom and the need to continue the fight for a unified nation.

The Gettysburg Address is a powerful and important speech that has had a lasting impact on American history. It is a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who fought for the preservation of the Union and the ideals of freedom and equality. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1776
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The Gettysburg Address does indeed argue that America was born in 1776, as it references the Declaration of Independence and the founding principles of the nation. The response incorrectly states that the speech did not argue about America's birth and instead focuses on the context and themes of the speech without addressing the specific question about the year America was born. The additional information provided, while accurate, does not directly answer the question and thus does not contribute to the correctness of the response.
[RESULT]: 2
