[PROMPT]: What European countries established states in Ghana?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The question is a bit tricky because it's not quite accurate to say that European countries "established states" in Ghana. 

Here's a breakdown of what happened:

* **European presence:** European powers like the Portuguese, British, French, and others had significant trading and colonial influence in Ghana. They established trading posts, forts, and settlements.
* **Trade and influence:** These European powers sought to exploit Ghana's resources, trade in gold and other commodities, and exert political influence. 
* **Indirect control:** While they didn't directly establish states in Ghana, they did exert control over certain areas and communities through treaties, alliances, and the imposition of their laws and customs.
* **Resistance:** The Akan people, the dominant ethnic group in Ghana, resisted European influence and fought for their independence. 

**Key points to remember:**

* **Ghanaian independence:** Ghana gained independence from colonial rule in 1957. 
* **European influence:** While Ghana is independent, the legacy of European colonialism continues to impact the country's political, economic, and social structures.


Let me know if you have any other questions about Ghana's history! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The UK
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed explanation of the European presence and influence in Ghana, but it does not directly answer the question of which European countries established states in Ghana. The reference answer is straightforward, mentioning the UK, while the response does not explicitly name any countries that established states. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct in discussing European influence but does not directly address the question accurately.
[RESULT]: 3
