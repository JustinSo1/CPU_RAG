[PROMPT]: What trail did Lincoln use a Farmers' Almanac in? 
[USER_ANSWER]: 

This is a bit of a trick question! 

* **Abraham Lincoln did not use a Farmers' Almanac for navigation on the trail to Gettysburg.**  
* The Farmers' Almanac is a weather forecasting publication, not a navigational tool. 
* Lincoln's primary navigation tools were likely a compass, map, and possibly local knowledge. 

Let me know if you'd like to know more about Lincoln's journey to Gettysburg! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: he defended William "Duff" Armstrong
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that Lincoln used a Farmers' Almanac in the trial where he defended William "Duff" Armstrong, not for navigation on a trail to Gettysburg. The response does not address the correct context of the Farmers' Almanac usage and instead provides unrelated information about navigation tools.
[RESULT]: 1
