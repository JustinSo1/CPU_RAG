[PROMPT]: Adams ' opponents were what?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The question is a bit tricky because it depends on what you mean by "opponents". 

Here's a breakdown:

* **In the context of a political campaign:**  If you're asking about the people who ran against John Adams for president, his opponents were **Thomas Jefferson** and **George Clinton**.
* **In the context of a broader historical debate:**  If you're asking about the people who disagreed with John Adams' policies or ideas, his opponents could be considered to be a wide range of individuals and groups, including **Thomas Paine**, **James Madison**, and **the Federalist Party**.

**To answer your question more specifically, you need to provide more context.** 

For example, you could say:

* "What were John Adams' opponents in the 1796 presidential election?"
* "Who were John Adams' political rivals during his presidency?"
* "What were the main arguments against John Adams' policies?" 


Let me know if you have a specific context in mind! 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Democratic Republicans
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed breakdown of potential opponents of John Adams in different contexts, including political campaigns and broader historical debates. However, the reference answer specifically identifies "Democratic Republicans" as the opponents, which is a more concise and direct answer. The response does mention Thomas Jefferson, who was a prominent Democratic Republican, but it also includes other names and contexts that are not directly aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is informative and partially correct, it is not completely aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
