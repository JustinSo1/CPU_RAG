[PROMPT]: How does the distribution size of the leopard compare to the distribution of other wild cats?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

The distribution size of the leopard is relatively **large** compared to other wild cats. 

Here's why:

* **Habitat:** Leopards are highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even deserts. This allows them to occupy a wide range of geographic areas.
* **Range:** Leopards have a larger geographic range than most other wild cats, including lions, tigers, and cheetahs. They are found in Africa, Asia, and parts of the Middle East.
* **Population:** While leopard populations are fragmented and declining in some areas, they still maintain a relatively large population compared to other wild cats.

**Comparison to other wild cats:**

* **Lions:** Lions have a more limited range, primarily found in Africa. Their distribution is also more concentrated in specific habitats like savannas and grasslands.
* **Tigers:** Tigers are found in Asia, but their range is smaller than leopards. They are also more specialized in their habitat preferences.
* **Cheetahs:** Cheetahs have a smaller range and are found in Africa and parts of Asia. They are adapted to open grasslands and savannas.

**Conclusion:**

While all wild cats face challenges due
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: As of 1996, the leopard had the largest distribution of any wild cat, although populations before and since have shown a declining trend and are fragmented outside of subsaharan Africa.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately states that leopards have a relatively large distribution compared to other wild cats and provides specific comparisons to lions, tigers, and cheetahs. However, it does not mention the specific detail from the reference answer about the leopard having the largest distribution as of 1996, nor does it address the trend of declining and fragmented populations outside of subsaharan Africa. These omissions prevent the response from being completely accurate and factual.
[RESULT]: 4
