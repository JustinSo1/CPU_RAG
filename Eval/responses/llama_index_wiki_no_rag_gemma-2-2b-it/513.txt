[PROMPT]: Can a panther be any of several species of large felid?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

A. Yes
B. No

**Answer:** A. Yes

**Explanation:**

Panthers are a general term for large, spotted felines.  While the most common association is with the **black panther**, which is a melanistic jaguar, there are several other species of large felines that can be called panthers. 

Here are some examples:

* **Jaguar:** The most well-known panther, known for its black spots and powerful build.
* **Leopard:**  A smaller, spotted cat with a distinctive rosette pattern.
* **Ocelot:**  A smaller, spotted cat with a distinctive rosette pattern.
* **Snow Leopard:**  A large, white-colored cat with a distinctive spotted pattern.

Therefore, the answer is **A. Yes**. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual. The answer "A. Yes" aligns with the reference answer. However, the explanation contains inaccuracies. For example, ocelots are not typically referred to as panthers, and snow leopards are not commonly called panthers either. The explanation about jaguars and leopards being referred to as panthers is accurate, but the inclusion of ocelots and snow leopards introduces some inaccuracies. Therefore, while the main answer is correct, the explanation is not entirely accurate.
[RESULT]: 4
