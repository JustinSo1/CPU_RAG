[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Qatar
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer indicates that Qatar is the country bordered by Saudi Arabia, but the response incorrectly states that Saudi Arabia shares a land border with Yemen and lists several countries as having maritime borders with Saudi Arabia, many of which are incorrect. The response does not align with the reference answer and contains significant factual inaccuracies.
