[PROMPT]: Is an elephant's skin tough?
[USER_ANSWER]: 

Yes, an elephant's skin is incredibly tough. It's made of a thick layer of **epidermis** that's covered in **dermal ridges** and **scales**. These scales are like tiny plates that overlap each other, making the skin incredibly strong and resistant to scratches and bites.

Here's a breakdown of the elephant's skin:

* **Epidermis:** The outermost layer of skin, providing a protective barrier.
* **Dermal ridges:** These are raised bumps on the skin that help to prevent water loss.
* **Scales:** These are overlapping plates that provide extra protection and strength.

The elephant's skin is so tough that it can even withstand the bites of predators like lions and hyenas. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual. It accurately states that an elephant's skin is tough and provides additional details about the structure of the skin, such as the epidermis, dermal ridges, and scales. However, the reference answer is very simple and direct, while the response adds a lot of extra information that, although accurate, is not necessary to answer the question. The additional details about the skin's structure and its resistance to predator bites are correct but not required for a complete answer based on the reference.
[RESULT]: 4
