[PROMPT]: Did Wilson not spend 1914 through the beginning of 1917 trying to keep America out of the war in Europe ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about Wilson's actions or efforts to keep America out of the war in Europe from 1914 through the beginning of 1917.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about Wilson's actions, which is not relevant to the question asked. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm Wilson's efforts to keep America out of the war. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
