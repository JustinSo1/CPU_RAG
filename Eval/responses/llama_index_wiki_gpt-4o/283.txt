[PROMPT]: What is the weather like at Lake Volta?
[USER_ANSWER]: The weather at Lake Volta is typically hot and dry during certain periods.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Warm and comparatively dry
[FEEDBACK]: The response "The weather at Lake Volta is typically hot and dry during certain periods" is somewhat correct and factual. It captures the essence of the weather being dry, but it introduces the idea of "certain periods" which is not mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, it describes the weather as "hot" rather than "warm," which is a slight deviation from the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is mostly accurate, it is not completely aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
