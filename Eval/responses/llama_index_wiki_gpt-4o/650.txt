[PROMPT]: What happened in a region not quite 2000 km south of the equator 35 mya?
[USER_ANSWER]: Significant diversification events within the Rhodniini and Triatomini tribes closely linked to climatic and geological changes occurred due to the Andean uplift in South America around 35 million years ago.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: At least one giant penguin.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided discusses the diversification events within the Rhodniini and Triatomini tribes due to the Andean uplift, which is not directly related to the reference answer about the presence of at least one giant penguin. The reference answer focuses on a specific species, while the response focuses on broader climatic and geological changes affecting insect tribes. Therefore, the response is not accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
