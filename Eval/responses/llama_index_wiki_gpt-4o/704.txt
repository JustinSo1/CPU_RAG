[PROMPT]: What happened in these positions in english?
[USER_ANSWER]: The well-known syndrome consisting of diplopia and facial pain due to a middle ear infection was named after Gradenigo. Despite being a pioneer of Italian Otology in the late 19th and early 20th century, little is written about his life and notable achievements in English literature.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: These allophones cannot occur there.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided does not address the question about positions in English. Instead, it discusses Gradenigo's syndrome and his contributions to otology, which is unrelated to the topic of allophones in English. The response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
