[PROMPT]: What type of creatures breathe air and don't lay eggs underwater?
[USER_ANSWER]: Some types of creatures that breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater include mammals like horses.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Amniotes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct, accurate, and factual. While it correctly identifies mammals like horses as creatures that breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, it does not provide the broader category of "amniotes" as specified in the reference answer. The response is specific rather than general, which makes it less comprehensive than the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
