[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that the significant event in 1865 was the surrender of Robert E. Lee, which is related to the end of the American Civil War. The response provided discusses the presentation of a paper on plant hybridization, which is unrelated to the historical event mentioned in the reference answer. Therefore, the response does not align with the correct event of 1865.
[RESULT]: 1
