[PROMPT]: Is the Adephaga suborder larger than the Polyphaga suborder?
[USER_ANSWER]: There is no information provided that compares the sizes of the Adephaga and Polyphaga suborders.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges a lack of information, but it does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. The reference answer is a straightforward "no," indicating that the Adephaga suborder is not larger than the Polyphaga suborder. The evaluated response fails to provide this direct answer and instead comments on the lack of information, which makes it less accurate and factual compared to the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
