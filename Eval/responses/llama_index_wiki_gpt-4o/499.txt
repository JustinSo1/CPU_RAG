[PROMPT]: What is the difference between leopards and cheetahs?
[USER_ANSWER]: Leopards and cheetahs differ in several ways. Leopards are generally more robust and muscular, with a stockier build, while cheetahs have a slender, lightweight frame adapted for high-speed running. Leopards have a unique pattern of rosettes on their coats, whereas cheetahs are characterized by their solid black spots and distinctive tear streaks running from the inner corners of their eyes down to the sides of their mouths. Additionally, leopards are known for their climbing abilities and often drag their prey into trees to avoid scavengers, while cheetahs are famous for their incredible speed, being the fastest land animals, primarily hunting in open grasslands where they rely on their speed to catch prey.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The leopard has roS08_settes rather than cheetah's simple spots and the leopard is larger and less lanky than the cheetah.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides detailed differences between leopards and cheetahs, including physical characteristics such as body build, coat patterns, and unique features like tear streaks in cheetahs. It also mentions behavioral traits like leopards' climbing abilities and cheetahs' speed. However, the reference answer is more concise and focuses on the primary differences in coat patterns and body build. The response goes beyond the reference answer by including additional details, which are accurate but not necessary for a perfect score based on the reference.
[RESULT]: 4
