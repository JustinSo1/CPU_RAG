[USER_ANSWER]: It is not specified in the provided information.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response "It is not specified in the provided information" is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual based on the reference answer, which is "Yes." The reference answer clearly indicates that the person did die at the specified time and date due to the after-effects of a stroke. The evaluated response fails to acknowledge this fact and provides misleading information.
[RESULT]: 1
