[PROMPT]: What carried with it a tacit recognition of Qatar's status as distinct from Bahrain?
[USER_ANSWER]: The approval carried with it a tacit recognition of Qatar's status as distinct from Bahrain.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The British Protectorate (per Colonel Lewis Pelly) asking to negotiate with a representative from Qatar after Bahrain's violation of the 1820 Anglo-Bahraini Treaty.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges an action that recognizes Qatar's distinct status from Bahrain. However, it lacks the specific details provided in the reference answer, such as the involvement of the British Protectorate, Colonel Lewis Pelly, and the context of the 1820 Anglo-Bahraini Treaty. These details are crucial for a complete and accurate answer.
[RESULT]: 3
