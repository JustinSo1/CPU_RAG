[PROMPT]: Are studies insufficient evidence for global protection?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, the studies provide insufficient evidence for global protection. Further research and larger-scale studies are needed to confirm efficacy and safety.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: It is arguable.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct, accurate, and factual. While it addresses the insufficiency of evidence and the need for further research, it does not align with the reference answer, which simply states "It is arguable." The response adds additional information that is not present in the reference answer, making it somewhat correct but not fully aligned.
[RESULT]: 3
