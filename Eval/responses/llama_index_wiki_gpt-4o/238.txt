[PROMPT]: Are there cathedrals scattered all across Finland?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about the distribution of cathedrals in Finland.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about the distribution of cathedrals in Finland. Instead, it mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the question asked. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that cathedrals are indeed scattered across Finland. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
