[PROMPT]: Why did Grant say "Damn, I had nothing to do with this batte."?
[USER_ANSWER]: Grant likely expressed frustration or discontent by saying, "Damn, I had nothing to do with this battle," because he felt unfairly associated with or blamed for an event or situation in which he had no involvement. This statement reflects a desire to distance himself from responsibility for the outcome of the battle.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: It went well.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it provides a plausible explanation for why Grant might have said, "Damn, I had nothing to do with this battle." However, it is not completely accurate or factual based on the reference answer, which simply states, "It went well." The response adds additional context and interpretation that is not present in the reference answer. Therefore, it does not fully align with the reference answer's simplicity and directness.
[RESULT]: 3
