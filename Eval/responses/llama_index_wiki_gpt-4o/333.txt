[PROMPT]: Did the Department of the Interior not charge that the rights of way for this land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The provided context does not contain information regarding whether the Department of the Interior charged that the rights of way for the land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question with a simple "yes" or "no" as the reference answer does. Instead, it provides an explanation about the lack of information in the provided context. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of addressing the question but not accurate or factual in the same manner as the reference answer. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for being completely correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
