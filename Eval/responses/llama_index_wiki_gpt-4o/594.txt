[PROMPT]: Where does the word "otter" derive from?
[USER_ANSWER]: The word "otter" derives from the Old English word "otor" or "oter," which is linked to the Proto-Germanic "otraz" and the Proto-Indo-European root "*udros," meaning "water animal."
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The word "otter" derives from the Old English word otr, otor or oter. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies the Old English origins of the word "otter" as "otor" or "oter," which aligns with the reference answer. Additionally, it provides extra information about the Proto-Germanic "otraz" and the Proto-Indo-European root "*udros," which, while not included in the reference answer, is accurate and relevant. However, the extra details are not necessary for the response to be considered completely correct based on the reference answer alone. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but includes additional information that is not required.
[RESULT]: 4
