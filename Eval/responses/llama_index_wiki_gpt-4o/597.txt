[PROMPT]: Why otters are considered as totem animals?
[USER_ANSWER]: Otters are often considered totem animals because they symbolize playfulness, creativity, and the ability to find joy in life. They are seen as a reminder to embrace our inner child, enjoy the moment, and not take life too seriously. Their behavior in the wild, such as their playful interactions and resourcefulness, embodies these qualities.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The time of year associated with this is also associated with the Aquarius sign of the Zodiac, through which the sun passes January 20-February 19.
