[PROMPT]: Can these allophones not occur in these positions in english?
[USER_ANSWER]: These allophones can occur in various positions in English, as the context does not provide any specific information about positional restrictions of allophones in the English language.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it addresses the concept of allophones and their positional occurrences in English. However, it does not directly answer the question posed, which is whether these allophones cannot occur in certain positions. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that there are positions where these allophones cannot occur. The response provided does not accurately reflect this and instead suggests that allophones can occur in various positions without addressing the restriction aspect. Therefore, it is not completely correct or accurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
