[FEEDBACK]: The response "Millard Fillmore was born in Cayuga County, New York, USA" is somewhat correct but not entirely accurate. While Cayuga County is in New York, the specific location of Summerhill is more precise and accurate. The response lacks the detail about the log cabin and the exact town of Summerhill, which are important factual elements. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but not fully accurate or detailed.
