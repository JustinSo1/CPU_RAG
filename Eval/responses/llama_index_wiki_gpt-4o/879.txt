[PROMPT]: What has many possible meanings?
[USER_ANSWER]: EETs have many possible meanings due to the diversity of biochemical and functional responses they produce.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: (What?)
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided, "EETs have many possible meanings due to the diversity of biochemical and functional responses they produce," does not align with the reference answer, which is simply "(What?)". The reference answer suggests that the question is either rhetorical or not meant to have a specific factual answer. The response introduces a specific term "EETs" and provides a detailed explanation, which is not relevant to the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
