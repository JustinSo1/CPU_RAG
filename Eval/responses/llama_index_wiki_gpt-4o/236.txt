[PROMPT]: What is the weather like in summer?
[USER_ANSWER]: Summer is generally characterized by hot weather.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: relatively warm
[FEEDBACK]: The response "Summer is generally characterized by hot weather" is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It aligns with the reference answer "relatively warm" in describing the general weather conditions in summer. However, the term "hot" is slightly more intense than "relatively warm," which suggests a milder condition. Therefore, while the response is accurate, it is not completely aligned with the reference answer in terms of intensity.
[RESULT]: 4
