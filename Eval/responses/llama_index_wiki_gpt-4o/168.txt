[PROMPT]: What types of unrelated water birds with similar forms are ducks sometimes confused with?
[USER_ANSWER]: Ducks are sometimes confused with coots or grebes.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: loons or divers, grebes, gallinules, and coots
[FEEDBACK]: The response is partially correct and accurate. It correctly identifies coots and grebes as birds that ducks are sometimes confused with. However, it is incomplete as it does not mention loons or divers and gallinules, which are also part of the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is factual, it lacks completeness.
[RESULT]: 3
