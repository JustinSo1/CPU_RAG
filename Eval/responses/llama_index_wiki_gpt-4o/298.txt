[PROMPT]: Why do wolves howl?
[USER_ANSWER]: Wolves howl as a form of communication. This behavior helps them to establish territory, coordinate pack activities, and maintain social bonds within the group.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Howling helps pack members keep in touch, allowing them to communicate effectively in thickly forested areas or over great distances. Howling also helps to call pack members to a specific location. Howling can also serve as a declaration of territory, as shown in a dominant wolf&apos;s tendency to respond to a human imitation of a "rival" wolf in an area the wolf considers its own. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately mentions that wolves howl as a form of communication, to establish territory, coordinate pack activities, and maintain social bonds. However, it lacks some specific details provided in the reference answer, such as howling helping pack members keep in touch over great distances or in thickly forested areas, and the dominant wolf's tendency to respond to human imitations of rival wolves. These additional details would have made the response more comprehensive and aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
