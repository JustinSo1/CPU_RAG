[PROMPT]: Did Wilson have any siblings?
[USER_ANSWER]: It is mentioned that there was an analysis involving families with Wilson's disease, including adjustments for siblings who died of other diseases. However, there is no specific information provided about Wilson's personal siblings.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided does not directly answer the question about Wilson's siblings. Instead, it discusses an analysis involving families with Wilson's disease and mentions adjustments for siblings who died of other diseases, but it fails to provide a clear and direct answer regarding Wilson's personal siblings. This makes the response somewhat correct but not fully accurate or factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "yes."
[RESULT]: 3
