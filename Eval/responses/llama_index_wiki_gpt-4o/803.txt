[USER_ANSWER]: No, turtles are not a part of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: *shrug*
[FEEDBACK]: The response "No, turtles are not a part of the Flying Spaghetti Monster" is a factual statement, but it does not align with the reference answer, which is a non-committal and humorous "shrug." The reference answer suggests ambiguity or a humorous take on the question, while the response provides a definitive answer. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but does not fully capture the intended tone or ambiguity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
