[PROMPT]: Was Wilson a remarkably effective writer and thinker?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Wilson's effectiveness as a writer and thinker.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about Wilson's effectiveness as a writer and thinker. Instead, it comments on the lack of context, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The reference answer is a straightforward "Yes," indicating that the expected response should affirm Wilson's effectiveness. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
