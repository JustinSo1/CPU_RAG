[PROMPT]: What is surplus killing?
[USER_ANSWER]: Surplus killing refers to a behavior where predators kill more prey than they can immediately eat or consume.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Surplus killing is defined as the killing of several prey animals too numerous to eat at one sitting.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It accurately describes surplus killing as a behavior where predators kill more prey than they can immediately consume. However, it does not mention the aspect of "too numerous to eat at one sitting," which is a specific detail included in the reference answer. This omission makes the response slightly less precise than the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
