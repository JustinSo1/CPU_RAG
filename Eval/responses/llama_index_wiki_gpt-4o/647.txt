[PROMPT]: Is it not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic lineage , or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae ?
[USER_ANSWER]: It is suggested that distinguishing phylogenetic signal from homoplasy is an implicit goal of any phylogenetic study, and that high amounts of homoplasy can interfere with accurate tree inference. Given this, it implies that the question of whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic lineage, or whether gigantism evolved independently in Palaeeudyptinae and Anthropornithinae, remains unresolved.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: It is not even known.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is somewhat related to the topic but does not directly address the question. The reference answer is concise and directly states that it is not known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic lineage or if gigantism evolved independently. The response, however, discusses the challenges of distinguishing phylogenetic signals from homoplasy and implies that the question remains unresolved, which is not as direct or clear as the reference answer. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but lacks the directness and clarity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
