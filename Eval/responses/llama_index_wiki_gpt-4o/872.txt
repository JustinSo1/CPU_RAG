[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that June is not Uruguay's warmest month, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it provides additional information that is not required by the instruction.

Therefore, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual but not completely aligned with the simplicity of the reference answer.
