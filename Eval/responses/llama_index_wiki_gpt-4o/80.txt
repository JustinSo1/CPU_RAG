[PROMPT]: Oxygen is what?
[USER_ANSWER]: Oxygen is a molecule essential for various physiological processes in the body, including acting as a building block or energy source within the brain, regulating differentiation of stem cells into insulin-producing cells, and being involved in the hypoxia response which affects cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic functions.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: One kind of gas obtained via a tracheal system.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate description of the role of oxygen in physiological processes. However, it does not directly address the simpler and more specific nature of the reference answer, which focuses on oxygen being a gas obtained via a tracheal system. While the response is factually correct, it diverges from the specific context provided by the reference answer. Therefore, it is not completely aligned with the reference answer's simplicity and directness.
[RESULT]: 3
