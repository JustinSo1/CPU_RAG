[PROMPT]: Is an elephant's skin tough?
[USER_ANSWER]: The toughness of an elephant's skin is not directly addressed. However, skin, in general, can be tough due to the presence of collagen, which provides tensile strength.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly address the question about the toughness of an elephant's skin. Instead, it provides a general statement about skin toughness due to collagen, which is not specific to elephants. This makes the response somewhat correct but not fully accurate or factual in the context of the question asked.
[RESULT]: 3
