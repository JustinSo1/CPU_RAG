[PROMPT]: What may a leopard be mistaken for?
[USER_ANSWER]: A leopard may be mistaken for other big cats with similar coat patterns, such as a jaguar, due to their spotted fur. However, the specific pattern and arrangement of the spots, as well as the habitat and geographical location, can help distinguish between the two.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: A cheetah or a jaguar
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that a leopard may be mistaken for a jaguar, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it does not mention a cheetah, which is also a correct answer according to the reference. The additional details about coat patterns, habitat, and geographical location are accurate but not necessary for the primary question.
[RESULT]: 4
