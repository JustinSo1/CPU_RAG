[PROMPT]: What unrelated water birds are ducks sometimes confused with?
[USER_ANSWER]: Ducks are sometimes confused with unrelated water birds such as tropicbirds (Phaethontidae) and the sunbittern (Eurypygidae).
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: loons or divers, grebes, gallinules, and coots
[FEEDBACK]: The response mentions tropicbirds and the sunbittern as unrelated water birds that ducks are sometimes confused with. However, these examples are not included in the reference answer, which lists loons or divers, grebes, gallinules, and coots. The response does not align with the reference answer and does not provide the correct examples. Therefore, it is mostly incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
