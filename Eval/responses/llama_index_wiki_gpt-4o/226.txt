[PROMPT]: Name an animal that is growing in number due to recent conservation efforts
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about any specific animal species that is growing in number due to recent conservation efforts.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Golden Eagle, Brown Bear, or Eurasian Lynx (Change imperative to interrogative)
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any specific animal species that is growing in number due to recent conservation efforts. Instead, it states that the context does not provide this information, which is not an accurate or factual answer to the instruction. The instruction asks for the name of an animal, and the response fails to address this directly. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
