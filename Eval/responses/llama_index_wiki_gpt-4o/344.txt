[PROMPT]: Did one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen not pierce with a cut-out design ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information on placing a piece of money or a metal screen between the phosphorescent substance and the paper.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. The question asks whether a piece of money or a metal screen with a cut-out design was placed between the phosphorescent substance and the paper, which requires a simple "yes" or "no" answer. The response instead states that the context does not provide information on this, which is not accurate based on the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and not factual.
[RESULT]: 2
