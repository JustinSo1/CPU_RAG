[PROMPT]: How many provinces and territories does Canada have?
[USER_ANSWER]: Canada has 13 provinces and territories.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: A federation now comprising ten provinces and three territories
[FEEDBACK]: The response "Canada has 13 provinces and territories" is mostly correct, accurate, and factual.

However, it does not specify the breakdown into 10 provinces and 3 territories, which is a minor detail but important for full accuracy.
[RESULT]: 4
