However, the response includes additional information that was not present in the reference answer. While this additional information is accurate, it goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer. According to the rubric, a score of 5 is given for responses that are completely correct, accurate, and factual, which this response is, but it is also more detailed than necessary.
