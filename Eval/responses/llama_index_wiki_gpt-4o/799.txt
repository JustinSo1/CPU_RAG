[PROMPT]: What has been discovered about turtles organs?
[USER_ANSWER]: There is no specific information about turtle organs in the provided context. The context mainly discusses the phylogenetic position of turtles, their genomic data, and their isochore structure in relation to other vertebrates.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: They do not gradually break down or become less efficient over time
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the specific information about turtle organs as mentioned in the reference answer. Instead, it discusses the context of the phylogenetic position, genomic data, and isochore structure, which is not relevant to the question about turtle organs. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
