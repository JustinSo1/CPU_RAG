[PROMPT]: Four years after opening his shop , Watt began what?
[USER_ANSWER]: Four years after opening his shop, Watt began his experiments with steam engines.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Watt began to experiment with steam after his friend, Professor John Robison, called his attention to it.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that Watt began his experiments with steam engines four years after opening his shop. However, it lacks the detail about Professor John Robison calling Watt's attention to steam, which is included in the reference answer. This omission makes the response less complete and slightly less accurate than the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
