[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Yes, the text states that Anders Celsius's thermometer had 100 for the freezing point of water. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and not factual. The instruction asks about the publication of a collection in 1738, but the response talks about Anders Celsius's thermometer, which is unrelated to the question. The correct answer should have been a simple "No," as indicated by the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
