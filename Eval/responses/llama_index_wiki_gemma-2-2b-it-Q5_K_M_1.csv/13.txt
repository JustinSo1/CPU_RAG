[USER_ANSWER]: 
 Hardin County, Kentucky

[FEEDBACK]: The response "Hardin County, Kentucky" is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies Hardin County as the place where Lincoln was born, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the inclusion of "Kentucky" is additional information that, while not incorrect, is not necessary based on the reference answer. Therefore, it is not completely aligned with the reference answer but still mostly correct.
