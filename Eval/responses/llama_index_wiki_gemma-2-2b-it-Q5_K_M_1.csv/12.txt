[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Lincoln represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional detail about the dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret, while accurate, is not necessary to answer the question directly. This extra information does not detract from the correctness but is not required for a perfect score based on the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
