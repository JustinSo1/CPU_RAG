[PROMPT]: Was Amedeo Avogadro born in Turin August 9th 1776 to a noble ancient family of Piedmont, Italy?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Yes. 
Explanation: 
The text explicitly states that "He is most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight." 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is partially correct in that it answers "Yes," which aligns with the reference answer. However, the explanation provided is irrelevant to the question asked. The question is about Avogadro's birth details, not his contributions to science. This additional information does not contribute to the accuracy of the response and detracts from its relevance. Therefore, the response is not completely correct and accurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
