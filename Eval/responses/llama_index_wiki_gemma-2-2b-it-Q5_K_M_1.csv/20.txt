[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln start his political career in 1832?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Yes, Lincoln represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not accurate in the context of the question. The question asks if Lincoln started his political career in 1832, which requires a simple confirmation. The response instead provides information about Lincoln's involvement with the Alton & Sangamon Railroad, which is unrelated to the question about the start of his political career. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and not factual in relation to the question asked.
[RESULT]: 2
