[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies the trial involving William "Duff" Armstrong and mentions the use of the Farmers' Almanac to discredit an eyewitness. However, the additional detail about the eyewitness lying on the stand, while accurate, is not necessary for the answer and slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
