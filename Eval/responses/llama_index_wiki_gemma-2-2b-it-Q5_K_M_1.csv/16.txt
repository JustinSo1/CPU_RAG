Explanation: 
The provided text states that Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth President of the United States.  It also mentions that the first president of the United States was George Washington. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The correct answer is "yes," as Abraham Lincoln did indeed beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election. The explanation provided does not address the question and instead gives unrelated information about Abraham Lincoln being the sixteenth President and George Washington being the first President. This does not contribute to the accuracy of the response.
