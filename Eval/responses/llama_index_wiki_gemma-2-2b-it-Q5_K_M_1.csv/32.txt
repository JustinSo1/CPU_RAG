[PROMPT]: Who was the general in charge at the Battle of Antietam?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation for several reasons. First, it was a war measure to weaken the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. Second, it showed that Lincoln had the support of Congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels. Third, it was a way to make the abolition of slavery an official war goal. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: General McClellan
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question asked. The instruction was to identify the general in charge at the Battle of Antietam, but the response discusses the reasons behind Lincoln issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, which is unrelated to the question. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
