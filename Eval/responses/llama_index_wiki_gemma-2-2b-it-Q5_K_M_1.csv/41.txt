[USER_ANSWER]: 
**7** 
---------------------
Explanation: 
The text states that Lincoln was "just seven years old when, in 1816, the family was forced to make a new start in Perry County (now in Spencer County), Indiana." 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response "7" is completely incorrect and not factual in relation to the question asked. The explanation provided does not address the question about Lincoln being chosen as a presidential candidate in 1860 and instead refers to an unrelated event from Lincoln's childhood. Therefore, the response does not meet any of the criteria for correctness, accuracy, or factuality based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
