[PROMPT]: Did his mother die of pneumonia?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, his mother died of typhoid fever.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct in that it accurately states that his mother did not die of pneumonia. However, it introduces additional information about the cause of death being typhoid fever, which is not present in the reference answer. This additional detail, while potentially factual, is not necessary and deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer. Therefore, it is not completely aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
