[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, it is not true that he published a collection in 1738.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is correct and factual, as it accurately states that it is not true that he published a collection in 1738. However, it is more verbose than the reference answer, which is a simple "No." While the additional detail does not detract from the accuracy, it does go beyond the succinctness of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
