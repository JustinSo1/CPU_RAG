[PROMPT]: Are elephants good swimmers?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether elephants are good swimmers, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether elephants are good swimmers. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question itself. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that elephants are indeed good swimmers. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
