[PROMPT]: What dwindled and eventually died out, starting with the Hartford Convention?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the Hartford Convention, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The Federalist Party
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question about what dwindled and eventually died out starting with the Hartford Convention. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question. The correct answer is "The Federalist Party," and the response does not provide this information. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
