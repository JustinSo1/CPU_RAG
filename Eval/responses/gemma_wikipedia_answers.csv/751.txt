[PROMPT]: What happened with a bromide emulsion in two sheets of very thick black paper?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, here's the answer: The scientist observed that the silhouette of a phosphorescent substance appeared in black on the negative, indicating that the substance was illuminated by the sun.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: the plate does not become clouded upon being exposed to the sun for a day
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is not entirely accurate as it does not match the reference answer. The mention of a phosphorescent substance and its silhouette appearing on the negative is not in line with the expected outcome of the bromide emulsion on the black paper. The response lacks the key detail that the plate does not become clouded upon sun exposure, which is the critical observation in this scenario.
[RESULT]: 2
