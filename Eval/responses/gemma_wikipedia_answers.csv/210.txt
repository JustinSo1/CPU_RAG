[PROMPT]: When did he drop John from his name?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about when John Adams dropped his name, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: upon graduating from college
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges that the context does not provide the specific information about when John Adams dropped his name, aligning with the reference answer. However, it does not provide the exact answer as stated in the reference answer, which was "upon graduating from college." Therefore, it falls short of being completely accurate and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
