[PROMPT]: What arrived in Britain?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about what arrived in Britain, hence I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The first Canadian Army units in WW II
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct information about what arrived in Britain. It states that the context does not provide any information, which is not accurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states that the first Canadian Army units in WW II arrived in Britain. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
