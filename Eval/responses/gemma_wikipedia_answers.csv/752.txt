[PROMPT]: Is there a becquerel crater on the moon and a becquerel crater on mars?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about a becquerel crater on the moon or Mars, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The instruction asks whether there is a Becquerel crater on the moon and Mars, and the reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that such craters exist on both celestial bodies. The response, however, states that there is no information provided to answer the question, which is not true. The response does not address the question correctly and fails to provide the factual information required.
[RESULT]: 1
