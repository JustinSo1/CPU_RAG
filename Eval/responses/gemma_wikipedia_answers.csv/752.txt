[PROMPT]: Is there a becquerel crater on the moon and a becquerel crater on mars?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about a becquerel crater on the moon or Mars, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer clearly states "yes," indicating that there are becquerel craters on both the moon and Mars. The response fails to provide this factual information and instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the correctness of the answer.
[RESULT]: 1
