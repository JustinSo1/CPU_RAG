[PROMPT]: Who was the first to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at the definition of an international temperature scale on scientific grounds ?

The correct answer, according to the reference, is Anders Celsius. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not meet the criteria for accuracy or factual correctness.
