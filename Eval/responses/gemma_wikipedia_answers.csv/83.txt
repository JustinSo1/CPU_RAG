[PROMPT]: Who graduated in ecclesiastical law at the early age of 20 and began to practice?
[USER_ANSWER]: I cannot answer this question from the context, as the context does not specify who graduated in ecclesiastical law at the early age of 20 and began to practice.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Amedeo Avogadro
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and does not provide the factual answer to the question. The reference answer clearly states that Amedeo Avogadro is the person who graduated in ecclesiastical law at the early age of 20 and began to practice, but the response fails to mention this and instead states an inability to answer based on context. This shows a lack of accuracy and correctness in the response.
[RESULT]: 1
