[CORRECT_ANSWER]: March 4, 1861
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges that the information about when Lincoln first served as President is not provided in the context, aligning with the reference answer. However, it does not provide the specific date of March 4, 1861, which is the correct answer. Therefore, it falls short of being completely accurate and factual as per the reference answer.
