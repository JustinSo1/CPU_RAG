[PROMPT]: Has tusklessness become a rare abnormality?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether tusklessness has become a rare abnormality, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that the context does not provide information about tusklessness being a rare abnormality, aligning with the reference answer "No." However, it does not explicitly state the answer "No," which would have been a more direct and concise response.
