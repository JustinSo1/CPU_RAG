[PROMPT]: What did James Monroe's letters not contain?
[USER_ANSWER]: James Monroe's letters did not contain any discussion of his religious beliefs.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No letters survive in which he might have discussed his religious beliefs.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that James Monroe's letters did not contain any discussion of his religious beliefs, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the phrasing is slightly different from the reference answer, which specifies that no letters survive in which he might have discussed his religious beliefs. The response does not explicitly mention the survival of letters, which is a minor detail but still relevant to the completeness of the answer.
[RESULT]: 4
