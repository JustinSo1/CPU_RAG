[PROMPT]: Was John Calvin Coolidge Jr. was born in Las Vegas?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about John Calvin Coolidge Jr.'s birthplace, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question with a factual statement. Instead, it deflects by stating that the context does not provide information about John Calvin Coolidge Jr.'s birthplace. The reference answer is a simple "No," which is a direct and factual response to the question. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct in acknowledging the lack of information but fails to provide the accurate and factual answer required.
[RESULT]: 3
