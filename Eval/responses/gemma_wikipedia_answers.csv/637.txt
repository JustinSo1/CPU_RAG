[PROMPT]: What European countries established states in Ghana?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about European countries establishing states in Ghana, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The UK
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and instead states that the context does not provide the necessary information. The question asks for specific European countries that established states in Ghana, and the reference answer provides "The UK" as the correct response. The evaluated response does not provide any factual information related to the question and is therefore completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
