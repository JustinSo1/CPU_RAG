[PROMPT]: What European countries established states in Ghana?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about European countries establishing states in Ghana, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The UK
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question about which European countries established states in Ghana. Instead, it mentions the lack of context, which is irrelevant to the question. The reference answer clearly states that the UK is the correct response. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not provide any factual information related to the question.
[RESULT]: 1
