[PROMPT]: Can beetles be found in polar regions?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether beetles can be found in polar regions, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that the context does not provide information about beetles in polar regions, aligning with the reference answer that beetles are not found in polar regions. However, the response does not explicitly state this fact, which could have improved the clarity and completeness of the answer.
[RESULT]: 4
