[PROMPT]: What allows a duck to filter water out of the side of their beaks and keep food inside?
[USER_ANSWER]: The lamellae on the inside of a duck's beak help filter water out of the side of their beaks and keep food inside by trapping and filtering water molecules.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Tiny rows of plates called lamellae
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies the lamellae as the structures that help filter water and keep food inside a duck's beak. However, it adds unnecessary details about trapping and filtering water molecules, which are not mentioned in the reference answer. Despite this, the core information is accurate and factual.
[RESULT]: 4
