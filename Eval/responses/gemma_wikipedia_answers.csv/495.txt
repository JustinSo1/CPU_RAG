[PROMPT]: Name an animal that is growing in number due to recent conservation efforts
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the answer is African elephants.

The context states that African elephants are now protected species worldwide, with restrictions in place on capture, domestic use, and trade in products such as ivory.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Golden Eagle, Brown Bear, or Eurasian Lynx (Change imperative to interrogative)
[FEEDBACK]: The response identifies African elephants as an animal growing in number due to recent conservation efforts, which is accurate and factual. However, the reference answer lists Golden Eagle, Brown Bear, or Eurasian Lynx, which are different examples. While the response is correct, it does not align with the specific examples given in the reference answer. Therefore, it is mostly correct and factual but not completely aligned with the reference.
[RESULT]: 4
