[PROMPT]: Name an animal that is growing in number due to recent conservation efforts
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the answer is African elephants.

The context states that African elephants are now protected species worldwide, with restrictions in place on capture, domestic use, and trade in products such as ivory.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Golden Eagle, Brown Bear, or Eurasian Lynx (Change imperative to interrogative)
[FEEDBACK]: The response identifies African elephants as an animal growing in number due to recent conservation efforts, which is correct and factual. The additional context provided about their protection status and restrictions on ivory trade further supports the accuracy of the response. However, the reference answer lists different animals (Golden Eagle, Brown Bear, or Eurasian Lynx) and suggests a change in the form of the question, which the response does not address. Despite this, the response is still mostly correct, accurate, and factual based on the given criteria.
[RESULT]: 4
