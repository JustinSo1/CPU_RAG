[PROMPT]: Are sports in Indonesia generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes

Instead, it states that there is no information provided to answer the question, which is not aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not meet the criteria for accuracy and factual correctness based on the reference answer.
