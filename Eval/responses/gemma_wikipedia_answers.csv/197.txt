[PROMPT]: Oxygen is what?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, here's the answer:

Oxygen is a gas that is essential for all living organisms, including aquatic turtles. It is used by aquatic turtles for respiration, and it is also involved in many metabolic processes.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: One kind of gas obtained via a tracheal system.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies oxygen as a gas and mentions its essential role for living organisms, including aquatic turtles. However, it does not mention the tracheal system, which is a key detail in the reference answer. The response provides additional information about oxygen's role in respiration and metabolic processes, which is accurate but not directly related to the specific detail in the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
