[PROMPT]: Oxygen is what?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, here's the answer:

Oxygen is a gas that is essential for all living organisms, including aquatic turtles. It is used by aquatic turtles for respiration, and it is also involved in many metabolic processes.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: One kind of gas obtained via a tracheal system.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a correct and factual description of oxygen as a gas essential for living organisms and its role in respiration and metabolic processes. However, it includes additional information about aquatic turtles that is not directly relevant to the question "Oxygen is what?" and does not mention the tracheal system as in the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is mostly correct and factual, it is not completely aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
