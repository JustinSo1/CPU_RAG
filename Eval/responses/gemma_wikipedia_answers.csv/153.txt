[PROMPT]: Did he not determine the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure -LRB- in excellent agreement with modern data -RRB- ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Anders Celsius's determination of the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes he did
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information to answer the question, which is not relevant to the task of determining the factual accuracy of the statement about Anders Celsius. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
