[PROMPT]: Did he not determine the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure -LRB- in excellent agreement with modern data -RRB- ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Anders Celsius's determination of the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes he did
[FEEDBACK]: The response accurately states that the context does not provide any information about Anders Celsius's determination of the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure, aligning with the reference answer that he did. However, it does not directly answer the question posed in the instruction.
[RESULT]: 3
