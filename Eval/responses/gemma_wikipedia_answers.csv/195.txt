[PROMPT]: Are many beetles territorial?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about the number of beetles that are territorial, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether many beetles are territorial. Instead, it mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the task of providing a factual answer. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that many beetles are territorial. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
