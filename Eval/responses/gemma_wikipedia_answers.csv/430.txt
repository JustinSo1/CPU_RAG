[PROMPT]: Can an elephant kill a rhinoceros?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about elephants killing rhinoceroses, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question "Can an elephant kill a rhinoceros?" Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about this, which is not relevant to the question itself. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the possibility. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
