[PROMPT]: Can an elephant kill a rhinoceros?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about elephants killing rhinoceroses, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead refers to the lack of context, which is not relevant to the task. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the response should be straightforward and factual. The evaluated response fails to provide a correct, accurate, and factual answer based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
