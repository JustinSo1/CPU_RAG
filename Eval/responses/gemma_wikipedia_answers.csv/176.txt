[PROMPT]: Is a beetle's general anatomy uniform?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, the context does not provide any information about the general anatomy of beetles, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect as it states that the context does not provide any information about the general anatomy of beetles, while the reference answer is "Yes," indicating that a beetle's general anatomy is indeed uniform. Therefore, the response does not align with the factual information provided in the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
