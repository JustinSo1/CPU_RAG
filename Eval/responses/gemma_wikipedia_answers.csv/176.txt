[PROMPT]: Is a beetle's general anatomy uniform?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, the context does not provide any information about the general anatomy of beetles, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes

The question asks about the general anatomy of beetles, and the correct answer is "Yes," indicating that beetles do have a generally uniform anatomy. The response provided does not address the question correctly and instead refers to a lack of context, which is irrelevant to the question itself.
