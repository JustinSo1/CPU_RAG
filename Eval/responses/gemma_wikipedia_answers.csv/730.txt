[PROMPT]: How many children did Grover Cleveland have?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the number of children Grover Cleveland had. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 5
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states that Grover Cleveland had 5 children, while the response claims that the context does not provide this information and therefore does not answer the question. This shows a lack of factual accuracy and correctness.
[RESULT]: 1
