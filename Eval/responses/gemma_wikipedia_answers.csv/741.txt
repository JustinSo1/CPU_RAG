[PROMPT]: What led Becquerel to investigate the spontaneous emission of nuclear radiation?
[USER_ANSWER]: Becquerel investigated spontaneous nuclear radiation after he found that photographic plates were fully exposed prior to performing the experiment.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: phographic plates being fully exposed
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that Becquerel's investigation was prompted by the exposure of photographic plates. However, it adds the detail "prior to performing the experiment," which is not mentioned in the reference answer and could be seen as an unnecessary addition.
[RESULT]: 4
