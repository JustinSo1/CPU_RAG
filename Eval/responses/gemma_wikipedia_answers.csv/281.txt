[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual, as it correctly states that France ceded nearly all of its colonies in 1763. However, the additional detail about the Seven Years War is not necessary and slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer. The reference answer is concise and to the point, while the evaluated response includes extra information that, although accurate, is not required.
