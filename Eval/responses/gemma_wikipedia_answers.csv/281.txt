[PROMPT]: Did France cede nearly all of its colonies in Europe in 1763?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in Europe in 1763 after the Seven Years War.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that France ceded nearly all of its colonies in 1763, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional detail about the Seven Years War, while historically accurate, is not necessary to answer the question directly and could potentially introduce confusion about the specific context of European colonies. The reference answer is more concise and directly addresses the question without additional context.
[RESULT]: 4
