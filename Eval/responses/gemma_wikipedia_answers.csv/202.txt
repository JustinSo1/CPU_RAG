[PROMPT]: Can beetles be found in almost all habitats?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that beetles are found in almost all habitats.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and accurate, as it confirms that beetles are found in almost all habitats. However, it adds unnecessary context ("the context says that"), which is not required and deviates slightly from the simplicity of the reference answer. The reference answer is a straightforward "Yes," which is completely correct and factual. The response could be more concise to match the reference answer's directness.
[RESULT]: 4
