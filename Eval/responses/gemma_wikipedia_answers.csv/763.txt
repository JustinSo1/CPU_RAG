[PROMPT]: Does Indonesia have the world's hightest level of biodiversity?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the world's highest level of biodiversity, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that the context does not provide information to answer the question, aligning with the reference answer "no." However, it does not explicitly state "no" as the answer, which would have been a more direct response. Therefore, it falls under the category of "somewhat correct, accurate, and factual."
[RESULT]: 3
