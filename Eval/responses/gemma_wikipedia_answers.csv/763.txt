[PROMPT]: Does Indonesia have the world's hightest level of biodiversity?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the world's highest level of biodiversity, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide enough information to answer the question, which is not relevant to the task of determining if Indonesia has the world's highest level of biodiversity. Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
