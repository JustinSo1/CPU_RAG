[PROMPT]: Does Indonesia have the world's hightest level of biodiversity?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the world's highest level of biodiversity, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Indonesia has the world's highest level of biodiversity. Instead, it states that the context does not provide enough information to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of information but does not provide a factual answer as required by the instruction. Therefore, it does not align with the reference answer, which is a simple "no."
[RESULT]: 3
