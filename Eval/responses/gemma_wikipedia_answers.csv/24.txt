[PROMPT]: Which county was Lincoln born in?
[USER_ANSWER]: Lincoln was born in Hardin County, Kentucky.

The context states that he was born on the Sinking Spring Farm, which is now part of LaRue County.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Hardin County
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Hardin County, Kentucky, as the county where Lincoln was born, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional context about Sinking Spring Farm and LaRue County introduces unnecessary information that could potentially confuse the reader. While the extra details are factual, they are not required to answer the question directly and succinctly. Therefore, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual but not completely aligned with the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
