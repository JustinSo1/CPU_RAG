The context states that he was born on the Sinking Spring Farm, which is now part of LaRue County.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Hardin County
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Hardin County, Kentucky, as the birthplace of Lincoln, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about Sinking Spring Farm and LaRue County, while factual, is not necessary for the response and could potentially confuse the reader. The primary question was about the county of birth, and the response should have focused solely on that.
