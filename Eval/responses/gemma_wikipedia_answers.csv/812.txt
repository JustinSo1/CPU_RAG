[PROMPT]: What is the first word on the page?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge. The context does not provide any information about the first word on the page, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: James
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided does not align with the reference answer "James" as it does not attempt to provide the first word on the page. It acknowledges the lack of information in the context but does not make an attempt to guess or provide any word. Therefore, it falls under score 1 as it is completely incorrect and does not address the question.
[RESULT]: 1
