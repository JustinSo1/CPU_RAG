[PROMPT]: What is the first word on the page?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge. The context does not provide any information about the first word on the page, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: James
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it explains the lack of context and the inability to find the answer, which does not align with the reference answer "James." The response is completely incorrect and does not address the question accurately or factually.
