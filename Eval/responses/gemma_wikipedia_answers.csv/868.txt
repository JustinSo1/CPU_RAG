[PROMPT]: Was Monroe anticlerical?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether James Monroe was anticlerical, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question of whether Monroe was anticlerical. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information to answer the question. This does not align with the reference answer, which is a definitive "no." Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
