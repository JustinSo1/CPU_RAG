[PROMPT]: Was Monroe anticlerical?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether James Monroe was anticlerical, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges that the context does not provide any information about whether James Monroe was anticlerical, aligning with the reference answer "no." However, it does not explicitly state the answer "no," which would have been a more direct response.
[RESULT]: 4
