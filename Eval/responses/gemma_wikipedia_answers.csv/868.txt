[PROMPT]: Was Monroe anticlerical?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether James Monroe was anticlerical, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question of whether Monroe was anticlerical. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of information but does not provide a definitive answer as required. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
