[PROMPT]: What body of water lies to the south of Finland?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge. The context does not specify the body of water that lies to the south of Finland, so I cannot answer this question.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: the Gulf of Finland
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. It does not provide the correct body of water that lies to the south of Finland, which is the Gulf of Finland. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the question due to a lack of context, which is not true as the question is clear and specific.
[RESULT]: 1
