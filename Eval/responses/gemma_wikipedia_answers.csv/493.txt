[PROMPT]: What body of water lies to the south of Finland?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge. The context does not specify the body of water that lies to the south of Finland, so I cannot answer this question.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: the Gulf of Finland
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and does not provide the factual answer to the question. Instead, it states an inability to find the information and does not mention the Gulf of Finland, which is the correct answer.
[RESULT]: 1
