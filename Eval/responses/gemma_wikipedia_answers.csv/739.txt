[PROMPT]: Did the team , sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide -LRB- laughing gas -RRB- , not remove his upper left jaw and portions of his hard palate ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the use of nitrous oxide-LRB-laughing gas, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question posed in the instruction. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about the use of nitrous oxide, which is not relevant to the question of whether the team removed Cleveland's upper left jaw and portions of his hard palate. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the removal. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
