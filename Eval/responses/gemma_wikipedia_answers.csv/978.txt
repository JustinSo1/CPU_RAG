[PROMPT]: What method is used by Kangaroos to travel?
[USER_ANSWER]: Kangaroos use hopping as a means of locomotion to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: hopping
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies "hopping" as the method used by kangaroos to travel, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it includes additional information about covering large distances in search of food and water, which, while true, is not necessary for the answer. The extra details do not detract from the correctness but are not required by the question.
[RESULT]: 4
