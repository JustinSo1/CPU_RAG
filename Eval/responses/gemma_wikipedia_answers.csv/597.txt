[PROMPT]: How do kwajalein and eniwetok relate?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about kwajalein and eniwetok, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The Monterey supported landings at both locations.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about the relationship between Kwajalein and Eniwetok. It states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question. The reference answer clearly states that the Monterey supported landings at both locations, which is a specific and factual relationship. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
