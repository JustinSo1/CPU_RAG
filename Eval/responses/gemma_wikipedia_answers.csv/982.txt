[PROMPT]: Are kangaroos farmed to any extent?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether kangaroos are farmed. Instead, it states that the responder could not find a good match in their knowledge base and provides no factual information. This does not align with the reference answer, which is a clear and factual "No." Therefore, the response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
