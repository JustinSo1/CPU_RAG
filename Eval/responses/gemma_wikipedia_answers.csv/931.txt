[PROMPT]: Is a kangaroo on the Australian coat of arms?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about a kangaroo being on the Australian coat of arms, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The question asks for a factual answer about the presence of a kangaroo on the Australian coat of arms, and the correct answer is "yes." The response does not provide this information and instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is irrelevant to the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
