[PROMPT]: Is a kangaroo on the Australian coat of arms?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about a kangaroo being on the Australian coat of arms, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether a kangaroo is on the Australian coat of arms. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the fact being asked. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer, which is a simple "yes."
[RESULT]: 1
