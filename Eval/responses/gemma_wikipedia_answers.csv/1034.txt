[PROMPT]: How does the distribution size of the leopard compare to the distribution of other wild cats?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about the distribution size of other wild cats, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: As of 1996, the leopard had the largest distribution of any wild cat, although populations before and since have shown a declining trend and are fragmented outside of subsaharan Africa.
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges the lack of information provided in the context and does not attempt to provide an inaccurate answer. However, it does not directly address the comparison between the distribution size of leopards and other wild cats as requested in the instruction.
[RESULT]: 3
