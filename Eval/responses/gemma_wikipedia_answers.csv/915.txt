[PROMPT]: In what ways was Adams opposed by Anderw Hamilton?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about how Adams was opposed by Andrew Hamilton, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Hamilton wanted to control the army differently than Adams
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about how Adams was opposed by Andrew Hamilton. It states that the context does not provide the information, which is not an answer to the question. The reference answer clearly states that Hamilton wanted to control the army differently than Adams, which is a specific and factual piece of information. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
