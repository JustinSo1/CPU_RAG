[PROMPT]: What expired on March?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about what expired on March, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Monroe's presidency

However, it does not directly mention Monroe's presidency as the specific answer. Therefore, it falls under the category of "somewhat correct, accurate, and/or factual."
