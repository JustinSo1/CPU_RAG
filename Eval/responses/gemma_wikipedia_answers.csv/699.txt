[PROMPT]: Was Grover Cleveland born in New York?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Grover Cleveland's birthplace, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question "Was Grover Cleveland born in New York?" Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about his birthplace. While this may be true, it does not address the question with a factual answer. The reference answer is a simple "no," which is a direct and factual response. Therefore, the evaluated response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
