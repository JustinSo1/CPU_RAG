[PROMPT]: Was Grover Cleveland born in New York?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Grover Cleveland's birthplace, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges the lack of information in the context and refrains from providing an answer that could be inaccurate. It aligns with the reference answer by not making any false claims. However, it does not directly answer the question, which could have been improved by stating that the birthplace of Grover Cleveland is not provided in the context.
[RESULT]: 3
