[PROMPT]: Was Adams the first to introduce a bicameral legislature?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Adams was the first to introduce a bicameral legislature, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges the lack of information in the context and refrains from providing an answer that could be incorrect. However, the response does not align with the reference answer, which is "Yes," indicating that Adams was the first to introduce a bicameral legislature. Therefore, the response cannot be considered completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
