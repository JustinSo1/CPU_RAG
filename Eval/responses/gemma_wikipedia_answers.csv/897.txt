[PROMPT]: Was Adams the first to introduce a bicameral legislature?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Adams was the first to introduce a bicameral legislature, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Adams was indeed the first to introduce a bicameral legislature. The response, however, states that there is no information provided to answer the question, which is not aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for correctness, accuracy, or factuality.
[RESULT]: 1
