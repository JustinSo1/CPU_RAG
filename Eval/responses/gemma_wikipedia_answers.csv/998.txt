[PROMPT]: What may a leopard be mistaken for?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge. A leopard may be mistaken for a cheetah or a lion, as they are all members of the cat family Felidae and share similar physical characteristics.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: A cheetah or a jaguar
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct and factual. It correctly identifies that a leopard may be mistaken for a cheetah, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it inaccurately includes a lion, which is not mentioned in the reference answer and is less likely to be mistaken for a leopard due to significant differences in physical characteristics. The response also includes an unnecessary preamble about the knowledge base, which does not contribute to the accuracy of the answer.
[RESULT]: 3
