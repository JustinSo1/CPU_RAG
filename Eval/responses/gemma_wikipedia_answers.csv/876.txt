[PROMPT]: Who died in childbirth in 1772?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about who died in childbirth in 1772, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Margaret Miller
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer itself. The correct answer, "Margaret Miller," is not mentioned at all, making the response completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
