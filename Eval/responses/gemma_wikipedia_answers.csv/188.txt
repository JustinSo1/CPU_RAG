[PROMPT]: Is the Adephaga suborder larger than the Polyphaga suborder?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge. The context does not provide any information about the relative sizes of the Adephaga and Polyphaga suborders, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a direct answer to the question asked. Instead, it states that there is no information in the context to answer the question, which is not accurate. The reference answer is a simple "no," indicating that the Adephaga suborder is not larger than the Polyphaga suborder. The response fails to address this directly and does not provide the correct information.
[RESULT]: 1
