[PROMPT]: Is the Adephaga suborder larger than the Polyphaga suborder?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge. The context does not provide any information about the relative sizes of the Adephaga and Polyphaga suborders, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a direct answer to the question asked. Instead, it states an inability to find information and does not address the relative sizes of the Adephaga and Polyphaga suborders. The reference answer is a simple "no," indicating that the Adephaga suborder is not larger than the Polyphaga suborder. The response fails to provide this factual information and is therefore not correct or accurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
