[PROMPT]: Who did Ford nominate for Vice President?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about who Ford nominated for Vice President, hence I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Bob Dole
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer itself. The correct answer, according to the reference, is "Bob Dole." Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not meet the criteria for accuracy or factual correctness.
[RESULT]: 1
