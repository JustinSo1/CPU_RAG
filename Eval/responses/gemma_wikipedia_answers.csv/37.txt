[PROMPT]: Do scholars rank lincoln among the top three presidents?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether scholars rank Abraham Lincoln among the top three presidents, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question, which is not relevant to the task. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
