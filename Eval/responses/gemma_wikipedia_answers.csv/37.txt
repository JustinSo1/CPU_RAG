[PROMPT]: Do scholars rank lincoln among the top three presidents?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether scholars rank Abraham Lincoln among the top three presidents, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of context but does not provide the factual answer that scholars do rank Lincoln among the top three presidents. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
