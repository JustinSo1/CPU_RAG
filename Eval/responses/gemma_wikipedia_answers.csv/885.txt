[PROMPT]: Was Adams raised Congregationalist?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about John Adams's religious affiliation, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not answer the question directly and instead states that the context does not provide the information needed. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that Adams was indeed raised Congregationalist. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
