[PROMPT]: Did Grand Rapids supporters not urge him to take on Bartel J. Jonkman , the incumbent Republican congressman ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Grand Rapids supporters urging Ford to take on Bartel J. Jonkman, the incumbent Republican congressman.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it addresses the context of the question, but it does not directly answer the question with a simple "No" as the reference answer does. The response provides additional information that is not required and does not directly confirm or deny the statement. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
