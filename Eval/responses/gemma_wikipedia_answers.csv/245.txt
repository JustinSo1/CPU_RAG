[PROMPT]: What year did Coolidge open his own law office?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide the year in which Coolidge opened his own law office, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1898

Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information, which is not an accurate or factual answer based on the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate.
