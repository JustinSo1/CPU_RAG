[PROMPT]: What is Canada's national unemployment rate?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, Canada's national unemployment rate is 1.7%.

The context states that Canada has a low national unemployment rate of 1.7%.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: While as of October 2007, Canada's national unemployment rate of 5.9% is its lowest in 33 years. Provincial unemployment rates vary from a low of 3.6% in Alberta to a high of 14.6% in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The national unemployment rate of Canada is not 1.7%, and the context provided does not align with the reference answer. The reference answer states that as of October 2007, the national unemployment rate was 5.9%, which is significantly different from the 1.7% mentioned in the response. Additionally, the response does not provide any information about the provincial unemployment rates, which is a key detail in the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
