[PROMPT]: Is it the world 's largest archipelagic state?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the world's largest archipelagic state, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether it is the world's largest archipelagic state. Instead, it mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the task of providing a factual answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer, which is a simple "yes."
[RESULT]: 1
