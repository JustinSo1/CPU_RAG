[PROMPT]: Is it the world 's largest archipelagic state?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the world's largest archipelagic state, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead states that there is no context provided to answer it. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that it is the world's largest archipelagic state. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
