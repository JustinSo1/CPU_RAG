[PROMPT]: What do kangaroos use for "crawl-walking?"
[USER_ANSWER]: Kangaroos use their tail to form a tripod with their two forelimbs and then raise their hind feet forward, in a form of locomotion called "crawl-walking."
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: its hind feet
[FEEDBACK]: The response accurately identifies that kangaroos use their tail to form a tripod with their two forelimbs and then raise their hind feet forward, which is not in line with the reference answer "its hind feet." While the response provides additional information about the locomotion method, it deviates from the specific answer requested.
[RESULT]: 3
