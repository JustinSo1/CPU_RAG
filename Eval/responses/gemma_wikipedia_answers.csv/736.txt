[PROMPT]: Was Cleveland 's portrait on the U.S. $ 1000 bill from 1928 to 1946 ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Cleveland's portrait on the U.S. $1000 bill from 1928 to 1946, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not answer the question directly and instead states that the context does not provide the information needed. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Cleveland's portrait was on the U.S. $1000 bill from 1928 to 1946. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
