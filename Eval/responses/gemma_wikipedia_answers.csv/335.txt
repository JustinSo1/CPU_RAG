[PROMPT]: Is Canada a geographically vast and ethnically diverse country ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Canada is a geographically vast and ethnically diverse country. It is the largest country in North America by land area and has a diverse population with over 20 different ethnic groups.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Canada is geographically vast and ethnically diverse, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about Canada being the largest country in North America by land area and having over 20 different ethnic groups, while factual, is not necessary to answer the question directly. The reference answer is very concise, and the response could have been more aligned with that simplicity.
[RESULT]: 4
