[PROMPT]: How long may elephants live?
[USER_ANSWER]: Elephants can live as long as 70 years. The context does not provide any other information about their lifespan.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 70 years
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly states that elephants can live as long as 70 years, which matches the reference answer. However, the additional sentence about the context not providing other information is unnecessary and does not add value to the response. The primary fact is accurate and correct, but the extra information slightly detracts from the conciseness and precision expected.
[RESULT]: 4
