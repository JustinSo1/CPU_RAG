[PROMPT]: Is Ghana in Asia?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge. Ghana is located in West Africa.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that Ghana is not in Asia and provides additional accurate information by stating that Ghana is located in West Africa. However, the response is more elaborate than necessary and does not directly answer the question with a simple "no," as the reference answer does. While the information is correct, the response could be more concise to match the reference answer's simplicity.
[RESULT]: 4
