[PROMPT]: Was Ford the last surviving member of the Warren Commission ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Gerald Ford was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a correct, accurate, or factual answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question, which is not relevant to the task of determining whether Ford was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirmatively answer the question. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
