[PROMPT]: Was Ford the last surviving member of the Warren Commission ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Gerald Ford was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a direct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the necessary information to answer the question. This makes the response completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "Yes."
[RESULT]: 1
