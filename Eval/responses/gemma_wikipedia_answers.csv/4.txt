[PROMPT]: Did his mother die of pneumonia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Theodore Roosevelt's mother's health or whether she died of pneumonia. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "no," indicating that the correct response should be a straightforward denial. The evaluated response, however, states that there is no information provided about Theodore Roosevelt's mother's health, which is not aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for correctness and accuracy.
[RESULT]: 1
