[PROMPT]: Was Celsius born in Uppsala in Sweden ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Anders Celsius' birthplace, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a correct, accurate, or factual answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about Anders Celsius' birthplace, which is not relevant to the task of answering the question directly. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Celsius was born in Uppsala, Sweden. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
