[PROMPT]: Today, are there more cell phone subscriptions than people in Finland?
[USER_ANSWER]: I cannot answer this question from the context, as the passage does not provide any information about the current number of cell phone subscriptions in Finland.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as required. Instead, it states an inability to answer based on the context, which is not aligned with the reference answer "yes." Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not provide the factual information needed.
[RESULT]: 1
