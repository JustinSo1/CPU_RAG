[PROMPT]: Was Indonesia named after it became an independent country?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Indonesia was named after it became an independent country, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. The reference answer is a simple "no," indicating that the correct response should be straightforward and factual. The evaluated response fails to provide this direct answer and is therefore not correct or accurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
