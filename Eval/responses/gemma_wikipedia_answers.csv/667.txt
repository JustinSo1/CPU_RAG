[PROMPT]: Do wolves leave their pack?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that wolves leave their birth pack when they reach sexual maturity prior to the previous breeding season.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual, as it accurately states that wolves leave their birth pack when they reach sexual maturity. However, it adds unnecessary details about the timing relative to the breeding season, which is not mentioned in the reference answer. This additional information, while not incorrect, is not required to answer the question directly and concisely as the reference answer does.
[RESULT]: 4
