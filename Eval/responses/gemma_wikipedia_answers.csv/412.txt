[PROMPT]: Does Egypt receive the least rainfall in the world?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, Egypt receives the least rainfall in the world, with an average annual rainfall of only 2 to 5 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in).
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual, as it correctly states that Egypt receives very little rainfall. However, the additional information about the specific amount of rainfall (2 to 5 mm) is not necessary and could be misleading, as it is not directly supported by the reference answer. The reference answer is concise and to the point, while the response adds extra details that are not required.
[RESULT]: 4
