[PROMPT]: Was Calvin Coolidge a governor of MassachuS08_setts?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Calvin Coolidge's role as a governor of Massachusetts. Therefore, I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not answer the question directly and instead states that the context does not provide the information needed. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that Calvin Coolidge was indeed a governor of Massachusetts. The response fails to provide this factual information and is therefore completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
