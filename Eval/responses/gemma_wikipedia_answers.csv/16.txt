[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "yes," indicating that Lincoln did beat John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 election. The response, however, states that there is no information provided to answer the question, which is not true according to the reference answer. Therefore, the response does not align with the factual information required.
