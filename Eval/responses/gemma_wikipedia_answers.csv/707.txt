[PROMPT]: What did Cleveland die from?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, Cleveland died of a heart attack at his home in Northampton.

I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: A heart attack
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that Cleveland died of a heart attack, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about the location (Northampton) and the statement about the knowledge base are unnecessary and do not contribute to the accuracy of the response. The core information is accurate, but the extra details slightly detract from the precision required by the rubric.
[RESULT]: 4
