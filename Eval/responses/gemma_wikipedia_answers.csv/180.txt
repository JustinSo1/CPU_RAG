[PROMPT]: How many species of beetles are there?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, there are about 350,000 species of beetles.

The context does not provide any other information about the number of species of beetles, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 350,000
[FEEDBACK]: The response initially provides the correct number of beetle species, which is 350,000. However, it then adds unnecessary information about the context not providing additional information, which is irrelevant to the question asked. The correct answer is given, but the additional commentary detracts from the accuracy and conciseness of the response.
[RESULT]: 4
