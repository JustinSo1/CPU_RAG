[CORRECT_ANSWER]: According to 2001 census, 77.1% of Canadians identified as being Christians; of this, Catholics make up the largest group (43.6% of Canadians). The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada; about 16.5% of Canadians declare no religious affiliation, and the remaining 6.3% were affiliated with religions other than Christianity, of which the largest is Islam numbering 1.9%, followed by Judaism: 1.1%.

However, it lacks additional context and details provided in the reference answer, such as the overall percentage of Christians, the largest Protestant denomination, and the percentages of other religious affiliations.
