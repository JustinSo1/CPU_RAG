[PROMPT]: What is the largest religious group in Canada?
[USER_ANSWER]: The largest religious group in Canada is the Catholic group, with 43.6% of Canadians identifying as Catholic.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: According to 2001 census, 77.1% of Canadians identified as being Christians; of this, Catholics make up the largest group (43.6% of Canadians). The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada; about 16.5% of Canadians declare no religious affiliation, and the remaining 6.3% were affiliated with religions other than Christianity, of which the largest is Islam numbering 1.9%, followed by Judaism: 1.1%. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response accurately identifies the Catholic group as the largest religious group in Canada, aligning with the reference answer that states Catholics make up the largest group with 43.6% of Canadians. However, the response lacks additional information provided in the reference answer about other religious groups in Canada, such as Protestants, those with no religious affiliation, and other religions like Islam and Judaism. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
