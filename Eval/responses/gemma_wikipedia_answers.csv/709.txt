[PROMPT]: How many years after Cleveland left office did the U.S. win the Spanish-American War?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the number of years after Cleveland left office when the U.S. won the Spanish-American War, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: One Year
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the necessary information, which is not relevant to the task of answering the question based on historical facts. The correct answer is "One Year," and the response fails to address this. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
