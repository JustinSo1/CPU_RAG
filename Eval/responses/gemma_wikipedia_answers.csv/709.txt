[PROMPT]: How many years after Cleveland left office did the U.S. win the Spanish-American War?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the number of years after Cleveland left office when the U.S. won the Spanish-American War, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: One Year
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the necessary information, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The correct answer, "One Year," is not mentioned at all, making the response completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
