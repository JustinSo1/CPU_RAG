[PROMPT]: Are wild kangaroos shot for meat?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context does not provide any information about whether wild kangaroos are shot for meat, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges that the context does not provide information about whether wild kangaroos are shot for meat, which aligns with the reference answer "yes." However, the response does not directly provide the answer "yes" as requested by the reference answer. Therefore, it falls short of being completely correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 4
