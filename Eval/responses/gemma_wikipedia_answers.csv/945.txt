[PROMPT]: Are wild kangaroos shot for meat?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context does not provide any information about whether wild kangaroos are shot for meat, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes

Instead, it states that the context does not provide information to answer the question, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer itself. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that wild kangaroos are indeed shot for meat. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
