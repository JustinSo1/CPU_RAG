[PROMPT]: When do African elephants lie down?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not specify when African elephants lie down, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: when they are sick or wounded
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about when African elephants lie down. Instead, it states that the context does not specify this information, which is not relevant to the question. The reference answer clearly states that African elephants lie down when they are sick or wounded, which is not addressed in the response. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
