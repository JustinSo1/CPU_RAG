[PROMPT]: Did John Adams support the Stamp Act of 1765?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether John Adams supported the Stamp Act of 1765, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "No," indicating that John Adams did not support the Stamp Act of 1765. The response, however, states that the context does not provide information about John Adams' stance, which is not aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, the response fails to address the question correctly.
[RESULT]: 1
