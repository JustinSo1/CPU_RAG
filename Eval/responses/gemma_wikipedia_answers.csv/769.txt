[PROMPT]: Which spice originally attracted Europeans to Indonesia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the spice originally attracted Europeans to Indonesia, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: nutmeg, cloves, or cubeb pepper
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any information about the spices that originally attracted Europeans to Indonesia. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This is not aligned with the reference answer, which lists specific spices (nutmeg, cloves, or cubeb pepper). Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not address the question based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
