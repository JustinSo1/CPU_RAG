[PROMPT]: Which spice originally attracted Europeans to Indonesia?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the spice originally attracted Europeans to Indonesia, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: nutmeg, cloves, or cubeb pepper
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any of the correct spices (nutmeg, cloves, or cubeb pepper) that originally attracted Europeans to Indonesia. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer itself. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
