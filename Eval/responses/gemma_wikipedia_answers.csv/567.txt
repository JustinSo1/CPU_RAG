[PROMPT]: What positions Ford played in the school football team?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, Ford played center and linebacker for the University of Michigan football team.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Center and linebacker
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies the positions Ford played (center and linebacker), but it adds unnecessary information about the University of Michigan, which was not asked in the instruction. This additional detail does not affect the accuracy of the positions mentioned but slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
