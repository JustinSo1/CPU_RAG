[PROMPT]: Are there cathedrals scattered all across Finland?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether there are cathedrals scattered all across Finland. Instead, it provides an explanation about the knowledge base, which is not relevant to the question. Therefore, it is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
