[PROMPT]: Who dismantled partisan and sectional coalitions ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about who dismantled partisan and sectional coalitions, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: many congressmen
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The reference answer clearly states "many congressmen," which is factual and accurate. The response fails to address this and does not provide any correct or accurate information based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
