[PROMPT]: Where was the largest elephant ever recorded shot?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the largest elephant ever recorded shot, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Angola
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer itself. The correct answer is "Angola," and the response does not mention this at all. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
