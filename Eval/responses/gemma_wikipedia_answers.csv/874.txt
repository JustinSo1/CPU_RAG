[PROMPT]: What happened in 1811?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about what happened in 1811, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Monroe returned to the Virginia House of Delegates and was elected to another term as governor of Virginia
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about what happened in 1811. It states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question. The reference answer clearly states that Monroe returned to the Virginia House of Delegates and was elected to another term as governor of Virginia in 1811. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
