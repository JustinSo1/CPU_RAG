[PROMPT]: Do wolf pups tend to have darker fur than adults?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether wolf pups tend to have darker fur than adults. Instead, it states that the responder could not find a good match in their knowledge base and provides no factual information. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "Yes."
[RESULT]: 1
