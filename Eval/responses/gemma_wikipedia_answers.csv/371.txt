[PROMPT]: What are some common predators of ducks?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, here are some common predators of ducks:

Birds, fish, mammals, and avian hunters are some of the main predators of ducks.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Pike, crocodilians, herons, hawks and eagles.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct and factual. It correctly identifies broad categories of predators (birds, fish, mammals, and avian hunters) but does not provide specific examples as the reference answer does (pike, crocodilians, herons, hawks, and eagles). The lack of specific examples makes the response less accurate and detailed compared to the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
