[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, he is most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly affirms the statement in the instruction, but it adds unnecessary information ("Sure, he is most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight.") that was not present in the reference answer. The reference answer is more concise and to the point.
