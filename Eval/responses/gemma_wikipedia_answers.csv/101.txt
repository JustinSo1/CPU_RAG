[PROMPT]: Is he most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, he is most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It confirms the statement in the instruction, similar to the reference answer. However, it adds unnecessary information ("Sure, he is most noted for his contributions to the theory of molarity and molecular weight.") that was not present in the reference answer. While this additional information does not make the response incorrect, it does not align perfectly with the simplicity and directness of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
