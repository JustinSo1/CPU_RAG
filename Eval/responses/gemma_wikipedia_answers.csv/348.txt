[PROMPT]: What animal attracts the most humor and silliness?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the animal that attracts the most humor and silliness, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The duck
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and does not provide an answer. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is irrelevant to the task. The reference answer is "The duck," which is a direct and factual response to the question. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
