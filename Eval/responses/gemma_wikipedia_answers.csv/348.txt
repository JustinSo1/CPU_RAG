[PROMPT]: What animal attracts the most humor and silliness?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the animal that attracts the most humor and silliness, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The duck
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide an answer to the question about which animal attracts the most humor and silliness. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the task. The reference answer clearly identifies "The duck" as the animal in question. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
