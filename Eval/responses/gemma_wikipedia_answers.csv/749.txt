[PROMPT]: Did one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen not pierce with a cut-out design ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about whether a piece of money or a metal screen was placed between the phosphorescent substance and the paper, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges the lack of information in the context regarding whether a piece of money or a metal screen was placed between the phosphorescent substance and the paper, leading to the inability to answer the question accurately. This aligns with the reference answer of "yes" as the context does not provide a definitive answer.
[RESULT]: 3
