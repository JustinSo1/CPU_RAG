[PROMPT]: Did one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen not pierce with a cut-out design ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about whether a piece of money or a metal screen was placed between the phosphorescent substance and the paper, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question with a simple "yes" as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide enough information to answer the question, which is not aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not meet the criteria for accuracy and factuality based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
