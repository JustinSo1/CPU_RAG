[PROMPT]: Did one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen not pierce with a cut-out design ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about whether a piece of money or a metal screen was placed between the phosphorescent substance and the paper, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that a piece of money or a metal screen was placed between the phosphorescent substance and the paper. The response provided does not affirm this and instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is not aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
