[PROMPT]: During what period was Akhenaten a Pharaoh?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not mention what period Akhenaten was a Pharaoh, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The New Kingdom (c.1550&#8722;1070 BC) 
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct period during which Akhenaten was a Pharaoh. Instead, it states that the context does not mention the period, which is not a factual answer to the question. The response fails to provide any accurate information about the New Kingdom period (c.1550â€“1070 BC) when Akhenaten ruled. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for correctness, accuracy, or factuality based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
