[PROMPT]: In which years were John Monroe elected as President?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the year John Monroe was elected President, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1817-1825
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct years when John Monroe was elected as President. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which clearly states the years 1817-1825.
[RESULT]: 1
