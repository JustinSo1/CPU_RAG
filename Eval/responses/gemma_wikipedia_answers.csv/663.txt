[PROMPT]: Does the Gray Wolf share an ancestry with the domestic dog?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the Gray Wolf's ancestry with the domestic dog, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about the Gray Wolf's ancestry with the domestic dog. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer itself. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the shared ancestry. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
