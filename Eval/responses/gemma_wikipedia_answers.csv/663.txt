[PROMPT]: Does the Gray Wolf share an ancestry with the domestic dog?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the Gray Wolf's ancestry with the domestic dog, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and instead mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the shared ancestry between the Gray Wolf and the domestic dog. The evaluated response fails to provide this information and is therefore completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
