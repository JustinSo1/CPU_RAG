[PROMPT]: Is Indonesia a monarchy with a presidential system?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Indonesia is a monarchy with a presidential system, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Indonesia is a monarchy with a presidential system. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information to answer the question. This is not accurate or factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "no." The response fails to provide the correct information that Indonesia is not a monarchy but a republic with a presidential system.
[RESULT]: 1
