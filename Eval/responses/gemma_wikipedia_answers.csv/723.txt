[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about when he was elected sheriff of Erie County, New York, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.

The reference answer is "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirmatively state that the information is not provided. Instead, the response incorrectly states that the context does not provide the information, which is not aligned with the reference answer.
