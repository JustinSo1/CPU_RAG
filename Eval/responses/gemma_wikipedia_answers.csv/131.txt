[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed translation of the title of the 1811 paper, which is more information than the reference answer. While the translation appears to be accurate, the instruction only asked for a rough translation, and the reference answer is a simple "yes." Therefore, the response is mostly correct and factual but includes unnecessary detail that was not requested.
