[PROMPT]: What expression is part of a conceptual framework for testing computer systems?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the expression "quacks like a duck", so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Quacks like a duck
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and does not address the question asked. Instead of providing the expression "quacks like a duck," it states that the context does not provide information, which is irrelevant to the instruction.
[RESULT]: 1
