[PROMPT]: Are large pythons potential prey for leopards?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about large pythons being potential prey for leopards, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether large pythons are potential prey for leopards. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question itself. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that large pythons can be prey for leopards. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
