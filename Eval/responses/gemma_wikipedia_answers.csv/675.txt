[PROMPT]: Why do wolves howl?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, here's the answer: Wolves howl to establish dominance, attract attention, and keep the pack together.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Howling helps pack members keep in touch, allowing them to communicate effectively in thickly forested areas or over great distances. Howling also helps to call pack members to a specific location. Howling can also serve as a declaration of territory, as shown in a dominant wolf&apos;s tendency to respond to a human imitation of a "rival" wolf in an area the wolf considers its own. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct and accurate but lacks depth and detail compared to the reference answer. It mentions that wolves howl to establish dominance, attract attention, and keep the pack together, which are partially correct reasons. However, it does not cover the aspect of communication over distances, calling pack members to a specific location, or the declaration of territory, which are important points mentioned in the reference answer. Therefore, the response is missing significant factual information.
[RESULT]: 3
