[PROMPT]: Is Egypt bordered by the Gaza Strip?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Egypt is bordered by the Gaza Strip. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question itself. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should be straightforward and factual. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
