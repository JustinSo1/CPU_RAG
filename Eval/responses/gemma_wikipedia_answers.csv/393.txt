[PROMPT]: Is Egypt bordered by the Gaza Strip?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The question asks for a factual answer about whether Egypt is bordered by the Gaza Strip, and the correct answer is "yes." The response incorrectly states that there is no information provided to answer the question, which is not true as the question itself is factual and does not require additional context.
[RESULT]: 1
