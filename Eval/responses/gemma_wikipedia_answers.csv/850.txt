[PROMPT]: When did James Monroe graduate from William and Mary?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about James Monroe's graduation from William and Mary, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1776
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct, accurate, and factual information regarding James Monroe's graduation from William and Mary. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer itself. The correct answer is "1776," and the response fails to mention this. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for correctness, accuracy, and factuality based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
