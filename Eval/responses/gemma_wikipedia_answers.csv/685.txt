[PROMPT]: Are wolves built for stamina?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that wolves are built for stamina, as they are capable of covering several miles trotting at about a pace of 10 km/h (6 mph), and have been known to reach speeds approaching 65 km/h (40 mph) during a chase.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and factual, as it accurately describes the stamina of wolves by mentioning their ability to cover several miles at a steady pace and their capability to reach high speeds during a chase. However, it includes additional information that is not present in the reference answer, which is simply "Yes." While the extra details are accurate, they are not necessary to answer the question directly. Therefore, the response is not completely aligned with the reference answer's simplicity.
[RESULT]: 4
