[PROMPT]: Is the leopard of the Felidae family?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the leopard is a member of the Felidae family.

The context does not provide any other relevant information about the leopard, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that the leopard is a member of the Felidae family, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about the context not providing other relevant information is unnecessary and does not contribute to the accuracy of the response. The core answer is correct, but the extra information slightly detracts from the conciseness and directness expected.
[RESULT]: 4
