[PROMPT]: Did the election of 1800 not become a bitter and volatile battle , with each side expressing extraordinary fear of the other party and its policies ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether the election of 1800 became a bitter and volatile battle, with each side expressing extraordinary fear of the other party and its policies.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. Instead, it comments on the lack of context, which is not relevant to the instruction. The reference answer is a simple "No," indicating that the election of 1800 did indeed become a bitter and volatile battle. The response fails to address this and is therefore not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
