[PROMPT]: What happened in 1764?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about what happened in 1764, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Adams married Abigail Smith
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about what happened in 1764. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question. The reference answer clearly states that Adams married Abigail Smith in 1764, which is a specific historical fact. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
