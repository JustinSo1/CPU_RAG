[PROMPT]: Is an official language of Canada German?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the official language of Canada being German, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. Instead, it deflects by stating that the context does not provide information about the official language of Canada being German. The correct and factual answer to the question is simply "No," as German is not an official language of Canada. Therefore, the response is not accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
