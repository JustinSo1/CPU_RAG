[PROMPT]: Which defense mechanism uses colour or shape to deceive potential enemies?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about the use of color or shape in deception, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: mimicry
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and instead comments on the lack of context, which is not relevant to the question asked. The correct answer, "mimicry," is not provided, making the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
