[PROMPT]: Which defense mechanism uses colour or shape to deceive potential enemies?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about the use of color or shape in deception, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: mimicry
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question correctly. It states that the context does not provide information, which is irrelevant to the question asked. The question is about a specific defense mechanism, and the correct answer is "mimicry." The response fails to provide any correct, accurate, or factual information related to the question.
[RESULT]: 1
