[PROMPT]: Is the leopard an Old World mammal?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the leopard's status as an Old World mammal, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges the lack of information provided in the context and refrains from making any assumptions or providing an inaccurate answer. However, it does not align with the reference answer, which is a simple "yes." Therefore, based on the rubric, the response falls short of being completely correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
