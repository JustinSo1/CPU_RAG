[PROMPT]: Is the Celsius crater on the Moon named after him ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the Celsius crater on the Moon being named after Anders Celsius, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question and instead states that the context does not provide information about the naming of the Celsius crater. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the crater is indeed named after Anders Celsius. Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
