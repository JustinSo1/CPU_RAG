[PROMPT]: Is the Celsius crater on the Moon named after him ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the Celsius crater on the Moon being named after Anders Celsius, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about the naming of the Celsius crater, which is not relevant to the task of answering the question. Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
