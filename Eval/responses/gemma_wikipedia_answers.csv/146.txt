[PROMPT]: Is The Celsius crater on the Moon named after him?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the Celsius crater on the Moon being named after Anders Celsius, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a direct answer to the question and instead states that the context does not provide information. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that the Celsius crater on the Moon is named after Anders Celsius. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
