[PROMPT]: Is Ford one of only four former Presidents to live to 90 or more years of age ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Ford is one of only four former Presidents to live to 90 or more years of age, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not answer the question directly and instead states that the context does not provide the necessary information. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Ford is one of the four former Presidents to live to 90 or more years of age. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
