[PROMPT]: Is Ford one of only four former Presidents to live to 90 or more years of age ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Ford is one of only four former Presidents to live to 90 or more years of age, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question with a simple "Yes" as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of information but does not provide the factual answer required. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
