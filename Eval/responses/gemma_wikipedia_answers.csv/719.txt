[PROMPT]: Is Grover Cleveland honest?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Grover Cleveland's honesty, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not align with the reference answer, which is a simple "Yes." The response instead states that there is no information provided to determine Grover Cleveland's honesty. This makes the response mostly incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
