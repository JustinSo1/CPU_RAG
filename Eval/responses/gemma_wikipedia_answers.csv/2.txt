[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln sign the National Banking Act of 1863?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Lincoln signed the National Banking Act of 1863, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not answer the question directly and instead states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that Lincoln did sign the National Banking Act of 1863. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
