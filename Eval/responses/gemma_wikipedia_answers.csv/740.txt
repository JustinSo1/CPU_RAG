[PROMPT]: He became chief engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways in what year?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not specify the year in which Ford inherited the cabinet Nixon selected during his tenure in office, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: in 1894
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual. It does not address the question about the year in which the individual became chief engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways. Instead, it provides irrelevant information about Ford and Nixon, which is unrelated to the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
