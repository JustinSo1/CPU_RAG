[PROMPT]: He became chief engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways in what year?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not specify the year in which Ford inherited the cabinet Nixon selected during his tenure in office, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: in 1894
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and does not address the question asked. The question pertains to the year someone became chief engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways, but the response talks about Ford and Nixon, which is irrelevant to the question. Therefore, the response is not factual or accurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
