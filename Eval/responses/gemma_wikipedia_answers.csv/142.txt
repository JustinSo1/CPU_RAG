[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the publication of a collection in 1738, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response indicates that the context does not provide information about the publication of a collection in 1738, which is not a direct answer to the question. The reference answer is a simple "No," which directly addresses the question. The response is somewhat correct in that it does not provide false information, but it does not directly answer the question as required by the reference answer. Therefore, it lacks the completeness and directness needed for a higher score.
[RESULT]: 3
