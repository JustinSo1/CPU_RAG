[PROMPT]: Is it true that massachuS08_setts sent him in 1774?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Massachusetts sent John Adams in 1774, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide enough information to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of context but does not provide the factual answer "yes" as required by the reference answer. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
