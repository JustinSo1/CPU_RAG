[PROMPT]: What is Monroe's father's name?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide the father's name, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Spence
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states that Monroe's father's name is Spence, while the response claims that the context does not provide the father's name. This indicates a lack of factual accuracy and correctness.
[RESULT]: 1
