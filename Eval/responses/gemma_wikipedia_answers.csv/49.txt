[PROMPT]: What trail did Lincoln use a Farmers' Almanac in? 
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Lincoln using a Farmers' Almanac to show that the moon was at a low angle, or how he used it to create a trail.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: he defended William "Duff" Armstrong
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. It mentions the context of using a Farmers' Almanac to show the moon's angle but does not identify the specific trial in which Lincoln used it. The reference answer clearly states that Lincoln used the Farmers' Almanac in the defense of William "Duff" Armstrong, which is not mentioned in the response. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
