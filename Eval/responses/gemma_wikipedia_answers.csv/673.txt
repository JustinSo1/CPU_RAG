[PROMPT]: How much do wolves weigh?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the average weight of wolves is between 32 and 62 kilograms (70 to 135 pounds).
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: typically varies between 32 and 62 kilograms
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides the average weight range of wolves in both kilograms and pounds, which is additional information not present in the reference answer. However, the reference answer specifies "typically varies," which implies a general range, while the response states "average weight," which could be interpreted differently. Despite this slight difference in wording, the factual content aligns closely with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
