[PROMPT]: Did Canadian soldiers win the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Canadian soldiers won the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Canadian soldiers won the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "Yes."
[RESULT]: 1
