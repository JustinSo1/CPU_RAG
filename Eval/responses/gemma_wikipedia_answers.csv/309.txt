[PROMPT]: Did Canadian soldiers win the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Canadian soldiers won the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states that Canadian soldiers did win the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917, while the response claims that there is no information provided to answer the question. This shows a lack of factual accuracy and correctness.
[RESULT]: 1
