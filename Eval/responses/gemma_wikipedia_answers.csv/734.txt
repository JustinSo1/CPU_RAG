[PROMPT]: Was Cleveland born in Caldwell, New Jersey to the Reverend Richard Cleveland and Anne Neal?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about Cleveland's birthplace, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not answer the question directly and instead states that the context does not provide the information needed. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that Cleveland was indeed born in Caldwell, New Jersey to the Reverend Richard Cleveland and Anne Neal. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
