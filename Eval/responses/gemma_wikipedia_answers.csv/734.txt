[PROMPT]: Was Cleveland born in Caldwell, New Jersey to the Reverend Richard Cleveland and Anne Neal?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about Cleveland's birthplace, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges the lack of information in the context and refrains from providing an inaccurate answer. However, it does not align with the reference answer which is a simple "yes". Therefore, it falls under the category of being mostly correct but not completely accurate.
[RESULT]: 4
