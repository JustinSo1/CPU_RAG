[PROMPT]: Did Grover Cleveland win the 1884 election?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Grover Cleveland won the 1884 presidential election, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The question asks whether Grover Cleveland won the 1884 election, and the correct answer is simply "yes." The response does not provide this information and instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
