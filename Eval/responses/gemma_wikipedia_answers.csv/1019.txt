[PROMPT]: Where is the leopard distributed?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the leopard is distributed across southern Eurasia and Africa.

The best locations to see leopards in Africa are in the Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve in South Africa, where leopards are habituated to safari vehicles and are seen on a daily basis at very close range.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: southern Eurasia and Africa
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is mostly correct and accurate as it correctly identifies the distribution of leopards across southern Eurasia and Africa. However, additional information about specific locations in Africa where leopards can be commonly observed does not directly address the question about the leopard's distribution. Therefore, the response is not entirely focused on the distribution aspect.
[RESULT]: 4
