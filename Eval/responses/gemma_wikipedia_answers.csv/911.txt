[PROMPT]: Where is Adams buried?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about the location of the tombs of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams and their wives in a family crypt beneath the United First Parish Church in Quincy, Massachusetts.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: United First Parish Church
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides a detailed and accurate description of the burial location of John Adams and John Quincy Adams, mentioning the family crypt beneath the United First Parish Church in Quincy, Massachusetts. However, the instruction specifically asks for the location of Adams' burial, and the reference answer is concise, simply stating "United First Parish Church." While the response is factually correct, it includes additional context that was not required by the instruction.
[RESULT]: 4
