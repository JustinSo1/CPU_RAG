[PROMPT]: Are Gray Wolves native to North America?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Gray Wolves are native to North America, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Gray Wolves are native to North America. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the fact itself. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that Gray Wolves are indeed native to North America. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
