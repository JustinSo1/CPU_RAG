[PROMPT]: Are Gray Wolves native to North America?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Gray Wolves are native to North America, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Gray Wolves are native to North America. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of information but does not provide the factual answer that Gray Wolves are indeed native to North America. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being mostly or completely correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
