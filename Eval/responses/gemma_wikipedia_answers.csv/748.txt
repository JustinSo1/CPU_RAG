[PROMPT]: Did he not die at the age of 55 in Le Croisic ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Pascal's age of death in Le Croisic, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes he died at the age of 55
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges that the context does not provide information about Pascal's age of death in Le Croisic, aligning with the reference answer that states he died at the age of 55. However, the response does not directly answer the question, which slightly affects its accuracy.
[RESULT]: 4
