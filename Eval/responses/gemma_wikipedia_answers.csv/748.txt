[PROMPT]: Did he not die at the age of 55 in Le Croisic ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Pascal's age of death in Le Croisic, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes he died at the age of 55
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a correct, accurate, or factual answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about Pascal's age of death in Le Croisic, which is not relevant to the question asked. The reference answer clearly states that he died at the age of 55, which the response fails to acknowledge or confirm.
[RESULT]: 1
