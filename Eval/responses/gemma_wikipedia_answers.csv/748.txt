[PROMPT]: Did he not die at the age of 55 in Le Croisic ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Pascal's age of death in Le Croisic, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes he died at the age of 55
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a direct answer to the question about Pascal's age of death in Le Croisic. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer, which clearly states that Pascal died at the age of 55.
[RESULT]: 1
