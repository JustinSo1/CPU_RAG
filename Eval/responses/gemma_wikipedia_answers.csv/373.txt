[PROMPT]: How does a Mallard's tongue work?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, here's an answer to the question:

A Mallard's tongue has tiny rows of plates called lamellae that help filter water out of the side of the beak and keep food inside.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: It's tongue is a flat plate, and on the tongue's back end is a short liftable flap with about 18 short spikes for pushing struggling prey and other food down its throat
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides some correct information about the Mallard's tongue, specifically mentioning the lamellae that help filter water and keep food inside. However, it does not mention the flat plate structure of the tongue, the liftable flap, or the short spikes that push food down the throat, which are key details in the reference answer. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but lacks several important factual details.
[RESULT]: 3
