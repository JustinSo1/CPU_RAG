[PROMPT]: Why did Cleveland want to hide his cancer surgery from the public?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about why Cleveland wanted to hide his cancer surgery from the public, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: To avoid further market panic
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question of why Cleveland wanted to hide his cancer surgery from the public. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer. The reference answer clearly states that the reason was to avoid further market panic, which the response fails to mention. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
