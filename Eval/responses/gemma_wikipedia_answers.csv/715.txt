[PROMPT]: Why did Cleveland want to hide his cancer surgery from the public?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about why Cleveland wanted to hide his cancer surgery from the public, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: To avoid further market panic
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and does not provide any factual information about why Cleveland wanted to hide his cancer surgery from the public. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The reference answer clearly states that Cleveland wanted to avoid further market panic, which is not mentioned in the response at all. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
