[PROMPT]: Had his thermometer 100 for the freezing point of water and 0 for the boiling point ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Anders Celsius's thermometer, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes it had
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about the thermometer's scale. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information about Anders Celsius's thermometer, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the thermometer's scale. The reference answer clearly states "Yes it had," indicating that the thermometer did have 100 for the freezing point of water and 0 for the boiling point. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
