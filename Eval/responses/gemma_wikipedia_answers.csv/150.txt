[PROMPT]: Had his thermometer 100 for the freezing point of water and 0 for the boiling point ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Anders Celsius's thermometer, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes it had
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states that the thermometer had 100 for the freezing point of water and 0 for the boiling point, while the response claims that there is no information provided to answer the question. This shows a lack of understanding or knowledge about the topic.
[RESULT]: 1
