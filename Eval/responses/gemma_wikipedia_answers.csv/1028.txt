[PROMPT]: Does a male leopard weigh more than a female leopard?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about the weight of male and female leopards, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "yes," indicating that a male leopard does weigh more than a female leopard. The response, however, states that the context does not provide information about the weight of male and female leopards, which is not aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
