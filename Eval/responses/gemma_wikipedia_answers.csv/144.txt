[PROMPT]: Was Celsius born in Uppsala in Sweden?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that Anders Celsius was born in Uppsala, Sweden.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Anders Celsius was born in Uppsala, Sweden, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the response adds unnecessary information ("the context says that"), which is not required for a simple yes/no question. This additional information does not detract from the factual accuracy but makes the response slightly more verbose than needed.
[RESULT]: 4
