[PROMPT]: Did Lincoln ever represent Alton & Sangamon Railroad?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that Lincoln represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that Lincoln represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it includes additional context about a dispute with a shareholder, James A. Barret, which, while not incorrect, is not necessary to answer the question directly. The extra detail does not detract from the accuracy but is not required for a complete answer based on the reference.
[RESULT]: 4
