[PROMPT]: What caused Calvin Jr.'s death?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about what caused Calvin Jr.'s death, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: heart attack
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states that Calvin Jr. died of a heart attack, while the response claims that the context does not provide any information about the cause of death. This shows a lack of alignment with the factual information provided in the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
