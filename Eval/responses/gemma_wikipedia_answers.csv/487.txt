[PROMPT]: Which Russian army general conquered Finland in 1809?
[USER_ANSWER]: I cannot answer this question from the context, as the context does not provide any information about which Russian army general conquered Finland in 1809.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Alexander I
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states an inability to answer due to lack of context, which is not relevant to the task of providing the name of the Russian army general who conquered Finland in 1809. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not meet the criteria for accuracy or factual correctness.
[RESULT]: 1
