[PROMPT]: What did Canada adopt in 1965?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, Canada adopted the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965.

The context does not provide any other information about what Canada adopted in 1965.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The Maple Leaf Flag
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that Canada adopted the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional sentence about the context not providing other information is unnecessary and does not contribute to the accuracy of the response. The primary answer is correct and factual, but the extra information slightly detracts from the conciseness and focus.
[RESULT]: 4
