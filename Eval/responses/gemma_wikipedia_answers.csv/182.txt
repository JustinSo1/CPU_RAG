[PROMPT]: When are sperm cells transferred to the female?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about when sperm cells are transferred to the female, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: during pairing
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct information about when sperm cells are transferred to the female. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the question asked. The reference answer clearly states that sperm cells are transferred "during pairing," which the response fails to mention. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
