[PROMPT]: When are sperm cells transferred to the female?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about when sperm cells are transferred to the female, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: during pairing
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question asked. The correct answer, "during pairing," is not mentioned at all. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
