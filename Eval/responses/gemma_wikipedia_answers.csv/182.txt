[PROMPT]: When are sperm cells transferred to the female?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about when sperm cells are transferred to the female, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: during pairing
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges that the context does not provide the information about when sperm cells are transferred to the female, aligning with the reference answer. However, it does not provide the specific correct answer "during pairing," which would have been a more complete response.
[RESULT]: 3
