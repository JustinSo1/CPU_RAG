[PROMPT]: What percentage of the population don't speak English or French at home?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 28%
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information or attempt to answer the question about the percentage of the population that don't speak English or French at home. It simply states that the knowledge base does not have a match and relies on the responder's own knowledge without providing any specific data. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer provided.
