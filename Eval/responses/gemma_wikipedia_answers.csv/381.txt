[PROMPT]: What types of unrelated water birds with similar forms are ducks sometimes confused with?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about types of unrelated water birds with similar forms that are sometimes confused with ducks, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: loons or divers, grebes, gallinules, and coots

Instead, it states that the context does not provide this information, which is not relevant to the question asked. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
