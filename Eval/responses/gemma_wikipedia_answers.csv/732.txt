[PROMPT]: Who lost control of his party to the agrarians and silverites in 1896?
[USER_ANSWER]: The Democratic party was seized by agrarian and silverite enemies in 1896, who nominated William Jennings Bryan on a Silver Platform.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Grover Cleveland
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. While it correctly identifies the Democratic party and the influence of agrarians and silverites in 1896, it fails to correctly identify the individual who lost control of his party. The correct answer is Grover Cleveland, not a general description of the party's situation.
[RESULT]: 2
