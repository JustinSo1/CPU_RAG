[PROMPT]: Was Ford released from the hospital?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about whether Ford was released from the hospital, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of information in the context provided. However, it does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. The reference answer indicates that Ford was released from the hospital, which the response fails to confirm. Therefore, the response is not completely correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
