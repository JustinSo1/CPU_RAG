[PROMPT]: Who or what vary greatly in form within the coleoptera?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about who or what vary greatly in form within the Coleoptera order, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Antennae.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead of identifying "antennae" as the part that varies greatly in form within the Coleoptera, the response states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question asked. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
