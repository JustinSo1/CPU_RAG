[PROMPT]: Who or what vary greatly in form within the coleoptera?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about who or what vary greatly in form within the Coleoptera order, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Antennae.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question asked. The correct answer, "Antennae," is not mentioned at all. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
