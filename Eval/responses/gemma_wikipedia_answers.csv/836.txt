[PROMPT]: Where was James Monroe shot?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about where James Monroe was shot, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: at the Battle of Trenton, in his left shoulder
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about where James Monroe was shot. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This is not aligned with the reference answer, which specifies that James Monroe was shot at the Battle of Trenton, in his left shoulder. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
