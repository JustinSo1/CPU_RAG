[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the freezing point of a thermometer, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. Instead, it states that there is no context provided to answer the question, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer itself. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the statement. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
