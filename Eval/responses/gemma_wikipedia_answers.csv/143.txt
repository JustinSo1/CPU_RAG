[PROMPT]: Is it true that thermometer had 100 for the freezing point?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the freezing point of a thermometer, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the freezing point is indeed 100, while the response states that there is no information provided to answer the question. This shows a lack of understanding or knowledge about the freezing point in question. Therefore, the response does not align with the reference answer and fails to provide the correct information.
[RESULT]: 1
