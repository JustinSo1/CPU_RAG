[PROMPT]: Where is Finland located?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, Finland is located in Northern Europe, in the Gulf of Finland.

[I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge].
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Northern Europe
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that Finland is located in Northern Europe, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about the Gulf of Finland is not entirely accurate as it implies that Finland is located within the Gulf, which is not correct. The Gulf of Finland is a body of water that borders Finland to the south, but Finland itself is not located in the Gulf. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but includes some inaccuracies.
[RESULT]: 4
