[PROMPT]: What was the result of the rejection of the Jay Treaty?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the result of the rejection of the Jay Treaty, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: As a result, the two nations moved closer toward the War of 1812. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about the result of the rejection of the Jay Treaty. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the necessary information to answer the question. This does not align with the reference answer, which clearly states that the rejection of the Jay Treaty moved the two nations closer toward the War of 1812. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
