[PROMPT]: Who is the head of state of Ghana?
[USER_ANSWER]: According to the context, the head of state of Ghana is President John Agyekum Kufuor.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: President John Agyekum Kofuor
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies John Agyekum Kufuor as the head of state of Ghana. However, the phrase "According to the context" is unnecessary and slightly detracts from the precision of the answer. The name "Kufuor" is also misspelled as "Kufuor" instead of "Kofuor," which is a minor error but still affects the accuracy.
[RESULT]: 4
