[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The most densely populated part of the country is the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor along the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River in the southeast.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor along the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River in the southeast as the most densely populated part of Canada. However, the phrasing "along the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor" is slightly redundant and less precise compared to the reference answer. Despite this minor issue, the response conveys the correct information.
