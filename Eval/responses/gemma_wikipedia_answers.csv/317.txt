[PROMPT]: Where is the most densely populated part of Canada?
[USER_ANSWER]: The most densely populated part of Canada is along the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor along the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River in the southeast.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The most densely populated part of the country is the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor along the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River in the southeast.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor as the most densely populated part of Canada and mentions the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River in the southeast. However, the phrasing "along the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor along the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River" is slightly redundant and less concise compared to the reference answer. Despite this minor issue, the response is still factually accurate and mostly correct.
[RESULT]: 4
