[PROMPT]: When did Islam become the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not specify when Islam became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: the end of the 16th century
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. Instead, it states that the context does not specify the information, which is not relevant to the task of providing an accurate answer. The correct answer, "the end of the 16th century," is not mentioned at all, making the response completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
