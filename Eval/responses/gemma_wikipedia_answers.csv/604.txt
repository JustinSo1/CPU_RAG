[PROMPT]: Did they not claim Ford 's pardon was quid pro quo in exchange for Nixon 's resignation ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Ford claimed Nixon's pardon was quid pro quo in exchange for his resignation.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: They did claim Ford's pardon was quid pro quo.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states that "They did claim Ford's pardon was quid pro quo," while the response states that the context does not provide any information about this claim. This directly contradicts the reference answer, which confirms the claim was made. Therefore, the response does not align with the reference answer and fails to provide the correct information.
[RESULT]: 2
