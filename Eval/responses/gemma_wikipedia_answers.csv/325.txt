[PROMPT]: What have been inhabited for millennia by aboriginal peoples?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the lands have been inhabited for millennia by aboriginal peoples, with evidence dating back to 26,500 years ago in northern Yukon and 9,500 years ago in southern Ontario.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The lands
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies "the lands" as being inhabited by aboriginal peoples for millennia. However, it includes additional information about specific dates and locations (northern Yukon and southern Ontario) that were not requested in the instruction. While this information is factual, it is not necessary for the response and slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
