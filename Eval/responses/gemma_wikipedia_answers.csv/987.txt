[PROMPT]: Was the game of Marn grook played using a ball made from kangaroo by the Kurnai people ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the game of Marn grook being played using a ball made from kangaroo by the Kurnai people, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges that the context does not provide information about the game of Marn grook being played using a ball made from kangaroo by the Kurnai people, which aligns with the reference answer "yes." However, it does not directly answer the question with a simple "yes" as the reference answer does.
[RESULT]: 4
