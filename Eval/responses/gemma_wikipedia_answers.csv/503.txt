[PROMPT]: Does it have a border with Norway?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a direct answer to the question about whether a country has a border with Norway. Instead, it states an inability to find a match in the knowledge base and relies on the responder's own knowledge without providing a clear answer. This makes the response completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "yes" or "no".
[RESULT]: 1
