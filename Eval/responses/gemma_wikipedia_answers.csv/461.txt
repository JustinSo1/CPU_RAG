[CORRECT_ANSWER]: elephant
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies the elephant as the land animal with the largest brain, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information provided about the size of the elephant's brain is somewhat confusing and inaccurate. The statement "with the largest elephants having brains that are about twice the size of an elephant's" is unclear and incorrect. This additional information detracts from the overall accuracy of the response.
