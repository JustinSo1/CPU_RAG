[PROMPT]: Was Gerald Ford a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Gerald Ford's membership in Delta Kappa Epsilon, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct answer to the question. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Gerald Ford was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. The response instead states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer itself. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
