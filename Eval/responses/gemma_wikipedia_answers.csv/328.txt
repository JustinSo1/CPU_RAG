[PROMPT]: Is it true that it angered many residents of the thirteen colonies?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether it angered many residents of the thirteen colonies, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of context to answer the question definitively. However, it does not directly address the question with a simple "yes" or "no" as the reference answer does. The response is not completely incorrect, but it does not provide the straightforward answer that the reference answer does. Therefore, it is somewhat accurate but not fully aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
