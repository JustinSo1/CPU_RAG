[PROMPT]: Is Ford related with the assassination of John F. Kennedy?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Gerald R. Ford's relationship to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about Ford's relationship to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Instead, it mentions the lack of context, which is not relevant to the question itself. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that there is a factual connection. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
