[PROMPT]: Is Ford related with the assassination of John F. Kennedy?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Gerald R. Ford's relationship to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that there is a relationship between Ford and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The response, however, states that there is no information provided about this relationship, which contradicts the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
