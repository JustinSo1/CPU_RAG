[PROMPT]: Is a collision with a vehicle capable of killing a kangaroo ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether a collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the task of determining if a collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that a collision can indeed be fatal to a kangaroo. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
