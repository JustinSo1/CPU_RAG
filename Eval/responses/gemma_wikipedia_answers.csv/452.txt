[PROMPT]: How do elephants communicate over long distances?
[USER_ANSWER]: Elephants communicate over long distances by producing and receiving low-frequency sound (infrasound), a sub-sonic rumbling, which can travel farther than sound travels through the air.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: by producing and receiving low frequency sound
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that elephants communicate over long distances by producing and receiving low-frequency sound (infrasound). However, it includes additional information about sub-sonic rumbling and sound travel through the air, which, while accurate, is not necessary based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
