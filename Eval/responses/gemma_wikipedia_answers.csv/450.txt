[PROMPT]: Is an elephant's skin tough?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that the skin around the mouth and inside of the ear is paper thin, indicating that the skin around the mouth and inside of the ear is not tough.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it addresses the toughness of an elephant's skin, but it focuses on specific areas (around the mouth and inside the ear) rather than providing a general answer. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the overall skin of an elephant is tough. The response does not fully align with this general fact and instead provides a more nuanced and less accurate depiction.
[RESULT]: 3
