[PROMPT]: Is an elephant's skin tough?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that the skin around the mouth and inside of the ear is paper thin, indicating that the skin around the mouth and inside of the ear is not tough.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The instruction asks if an elephant's skin is tough, and the reference answer is a simple "yes." The response provided discusses specific areas of the elephant's skin that are thin, which is not relevant to the general toughness of an elephant's skin. Therefore, it does not align with the reference answer and fails to address the overall toughness of an elephant's skin accurately.
[RESULT]: 2
