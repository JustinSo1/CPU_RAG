[PROMPT]: Is the capital city Oslo?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the capital city of Oslo, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of context, but it fails to directly answer the question. The reference answer is a simple "no," which is clear and concise. The response does not provide a direct answer and instead focuses on the lack of context, which is not necessary for this task. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for correctness, accuracy, and factuality as outlined in the rubric.
[RESULT]: 3
