[PROMPT]: Is the capital city Oslo?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the capital city of Oslo, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The question is asking if Oslo is the capital city, and the correct answer is simply "no." The response provided does not address the question directly and instead talks about the lack of context, which is irrelevant to the question asked. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for correctness, accuracy, or factuality.
[RESULT]: 1
