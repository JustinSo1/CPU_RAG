[PROMPT]: When did James Monroe introduce the Monroe Doctrine?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not specify the year in which James Monroe introduced the Monroe Doctrine, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: December 2, 1823
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct, accurate, and factual information regarding the date when James Monroe introduced the Monroe Doctrine. Instead, it states that the context does not specify the year, which is not relevant to the instruction. The correct answer is December 2, 1823, and the response fails to mention this. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
