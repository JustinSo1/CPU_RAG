[PROMPT]: hard
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge. The context does not provide any information about the posture of an elephant's throat and mouth area, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: hard
[FEEDBACK]: The response accurately acknowledges the lack of information in the context and provides a clear explanation for not being able to answer the question. It aligns with the reference answer by stating the difficulty of the question. However, it does not directly address the specific topic of "hard" as in the reference answer, which slightly affects the accuracy.
[RESULT]: 4
