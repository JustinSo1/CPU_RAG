[PROMPT]: Do kangaroos have many natural predators?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether kangaroos have many natural predators, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges that the context does not provide information about whether kangaroos have many natural predators, aligning with the reference answer "no." However, it does not directly provide the answer but rather states the limitation in the context. Therefore, it falls under the category of being somewhat correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
