[PROMPT]: Who assassinated Lincoln?
[USER_ANSWER]: John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln.

The context does not provide any other information about who assassinated Lincoln.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: John Wilkes Booth
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies John Wilkes Booth as the assassin of Abraham Lincoln, which is accurate and factual. However, the additional sentence about the context not providing other information is unnecessary and does not add value to the response. The core answer is correct, but the extra information slightly detracts from the conciseness expected in the response.
[RESULT]: 4
