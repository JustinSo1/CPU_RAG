[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about the year of James Monroe's election, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Monroe was elected president in the election of 1816, and re-elected in 1820.

Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the task of answering the question. The response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer, which clearly states the years Monroe was elected and re-elected.
