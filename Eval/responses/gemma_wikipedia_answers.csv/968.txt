[PROMPT]: What method of locomotion do Kangaroos Use?
[USER_ANSWER]: Kangaroos use hopping as a means of locomotion. They can hop at speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) over short distances, but they typically maintain a speed of 20-25 km/h (13-16 mph).
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: hopping
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies "hopping" as the method of locomotion used by kangaroos, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about their speeds, while accurate, is not necessary for the answer and slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
