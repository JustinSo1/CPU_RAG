[PROMPT]: Was James Cook the first to record the name "Kangooroo?"
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether James Cook was the first to record the name "Kangooroo".

The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that James Cook was indeed the first to record the name "Kangooroo." Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
