[PROMPT]: Have Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise been known to leap in front of cars ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about kangaroos dazing or startled by engine noise, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response accurately acknowledges the lack of information in the context and refrains from providing an answer based on assumptions. However, it does not directly address the question posed.
[RESULT]: 3
