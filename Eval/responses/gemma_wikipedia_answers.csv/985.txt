[PROMPT]: Have Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise been known to leap in front of cars ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about kangaroos dazing or startled by engine noise, so I cannot answer this question from the context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of context but does not provide the factual answer that is expected. Therefore, it is not accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
