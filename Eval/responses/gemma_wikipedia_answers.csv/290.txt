[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Chinese.
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Chinese as a significant non-official language, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information provided about the number of speakers and its prevalence in Canada is not necessary and slightly detracts from the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. Despite this, the response remains factually accurate and correct.
[RESULT]: 4
