[PROMPT]: What is the world population of Asian elephants?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the world population of Asian elephants is estimated to be between 38,000 and 53,000.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 60000
[FEEDBACK]: The response provides an estimate of the world population of Asian elephants that is significantly lower than the reference answer. While it is somewhat correct in that it gives a range, the numbers provided (38,000 to 53,000) do not align closely with the reference answer of 60,000. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but not mostly or completely accurate.
[RESULT]: 3
