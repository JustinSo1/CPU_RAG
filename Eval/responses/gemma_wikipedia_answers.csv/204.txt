[PROMPT]: Was Calvin Coolidge the twenty-ninth vice president?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about whether Calvin Coolidge was the twenty-ninth vice president, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question of whether Calvin Coolidge was the twenty-ninth vice president. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of information but does not provide the factual answer "no" as required by the reference answer. Therefore, it is not completely correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
