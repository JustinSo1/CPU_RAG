[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that the Republic of Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies Indonesia as the world's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation. However, the response adds unnecessary context ("the context says that the Republic of Indonesia") which was not required by the instruction. The reference answer is more concise and directly answers the question with a simple "yes."
[RESULT]: 4
