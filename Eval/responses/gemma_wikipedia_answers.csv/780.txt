[PROMPT]: Is Pencak Silat an Indonesian martial art ?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide information about Pencak Silat, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question itself. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that Pencak Silat is indeed an Indonesian martial art. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not provide any factual information related to the question.
[RESULT]: 1
