[PROMPT]: What is the first number on the page?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge. The first number on the page is not mentioned in the context, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 28
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is accurate and factual based on the reference answer as it acknowledges the lack of information in the context and provides a clear explanation for not being able to answer the question. This aligns with the criteria of being correct and accurate. However, since the response does not provide the actual first number on the page, it falls short of being completely correct and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
