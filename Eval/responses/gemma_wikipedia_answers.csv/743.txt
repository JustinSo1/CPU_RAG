[PROMPT]: Is it true that he shared the nobel prize in physics?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Marconi shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it addresses the lack of context, but it does not directly answer the question as the reference answer does. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that Marconi did share the Nobel Prize in Physics. The response provided does not confirm this fact and instead focuses on the lack of information in the context, which makes it less accurate and factual compared to the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
