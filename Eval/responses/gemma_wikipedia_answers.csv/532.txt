[PROMPT]: What is a country with which Finland is involved in an international conflict?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Finland is not involved in international conflicts or border disputes. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information regarding Finland's involvement in international conflicts. Instead, it states an inability to find a match in the knowledge base and relies on the responder's own knowledge without providing a clear answer. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which clearly states that Finland is not involved in international conflicts or border disputes.
[RESULT]: 1
