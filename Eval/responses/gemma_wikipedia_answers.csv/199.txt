[PROMPT]: Have coleopterists formed organisations to facilitate the study of beetles ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Yes, the context says that coleopterists have formed organizations to facilitate the study of beetles, including The Coleopterists Society, an international organization based in the United States.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that coleopterists have formed organizations to facilitate the study of beetles, which aligns with the reference answer. However, it includes additional information about The Coleopterists Society and its location, which is not present in the reference answer. While this additional information is accurate, it is not necessary to answer the question directly and concisely as the reference answer does. Therefore, the response is not completely aligned with the simplicity and directness of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
