[PROMPT]: Did John Adams get along with Alexander Hamilton?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the relationship between John Adams and Alexander Hamilton, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges the lack of information in the context and refrains from providing an inaccurate answer. However, it does not align with the reference answer which is a simple "No." Therefore, it falls under the category of being mostly correct but not completely accurate.
