[PROMPT]: What are the similarities between beetles and grasshoppers?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the similarities between beetles and grasshoppers, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: mouthparts
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the similarities between beetles and grasshoppers as requested. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is irrelevant to the question. The reference answer indicates that "mouthparts" is a similarity, which the response fails to mention. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
