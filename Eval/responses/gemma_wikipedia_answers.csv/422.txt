According to the context, Egypt is one of the most populous countries in Africa, with an estimated 78 million people.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: More than 78 million.
[FEEDBACK]: The response states that the estimated population of Egypt is 78 million, which is not completely accurate based on the reference answer "More than 78 million." While the response provides a specific number, it does not fully capture the fact that the population is more than 78 million. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but not entirely accurate or factual.
