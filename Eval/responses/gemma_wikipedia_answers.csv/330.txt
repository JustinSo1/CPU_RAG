[PROMPT]: Is it true that provinces have a large degree of autonomy?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context says that provinces have a large degree of autonomy from the federal government.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct and accurate, as it confirms that provinces have a large degree of autonomy. However, it adds unnecessary context about the federal government, which is not present in the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that a concise confirmation is sufficient. The response could be improved by being more concise and directly answering the question without additional context.
[RESULT]: 4
