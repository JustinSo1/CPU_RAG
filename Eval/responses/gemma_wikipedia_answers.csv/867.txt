[PROMPT]: What did James Monroe make in 1817?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not specify what James Monroe made in 1817, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: two long tours
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct information about what James Monroe made in 1817. The reference answer indicates that he made "two long tours," but the response states that the context does not specify this information. This makes the response completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
