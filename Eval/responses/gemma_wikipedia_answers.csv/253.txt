[PROMPT]: Have there been other US presidents that have visited Cuba?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about other US presidents that have visited Cuba, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether other US presidents have visited Cuba. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response somewhat correct in terms of acknowledging the lack of information but does not provide a factual answer as required by the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
