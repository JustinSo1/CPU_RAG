[PROMPT]: Who was John Monroe standing behind in the painting of  Washington Crossing the Delaware?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about John Monroe, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: George Washington
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and does not provide the factual answer to the question. The reference answer clearly states that John Monroe was standing behind George Washington in the painting of Washington Crossing the Delaware, but the response fails to mention this and instead states that the context does not provide any information about John Monroe. This indicates a lack of accuracy and correctness based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
