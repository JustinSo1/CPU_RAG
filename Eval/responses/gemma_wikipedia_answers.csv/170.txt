[PROMPT]: What do beetles eat?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, here's the answer:

Beetles eat both plants and animals, or they are highly specialized in their diet. Many species are host specific, feeding on only a single species of plant.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Some are generalists, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialised in their diet.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly states that beetles eat both plants and animals and mentions that many species are host-specific. However, it adds unnecessary information about beetles being highly specialized in their diet, which is not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer. The response could be more concise and aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
