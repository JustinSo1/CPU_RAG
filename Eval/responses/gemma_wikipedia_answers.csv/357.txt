[PROMPT]: Do ducks forage underwater?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a direct answer to the question "Do ducks forage underwater?" Instead, it states an inability to find a match in the knowledge base and relies on the responder's own knowledge without actually answering the question. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "yes."
[RESULT]: 1
