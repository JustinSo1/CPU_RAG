[PROMPT]: Is English the official language?
[USER_ANSWER]: I couldn't find a good match in my knowledge base for your question, hence I answer based on my own knowledge.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question "Is English the official language?" and instead provides an explanation about the knowledge base. This makes the response completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "yes."
[RESULT]: 1
