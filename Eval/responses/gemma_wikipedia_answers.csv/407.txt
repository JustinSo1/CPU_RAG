[PROMPT]: Are there a large number of Jews living in Egypt today?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the number of Jews living in Egypt today, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges the lack of information in the context and refrains from providing an inaccurate answer. However, it does not align with the reference answer which is a simple "no". Therefore, it falls under the category of "somewhat correct, accurate, and/or factual" as it does not directly answer the question.
[RESULT]: 3
