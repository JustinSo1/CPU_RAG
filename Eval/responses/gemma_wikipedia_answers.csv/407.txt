[PROMPT]: Are there a large number of Jews living in Egypt today?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the number of Jews living in Egypt today, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question asked. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question itself. The reference answer is a simple "no," indicating that the correct response should be straightforward and factual. The evaluated response fails to provide this direct answer and thus does not meet the criteria for correctness, accuracy, and factuality as outlined in the rubric.
[RESULT]: 1
