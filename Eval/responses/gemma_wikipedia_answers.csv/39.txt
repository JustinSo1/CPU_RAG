[PROMPT]: Did lincoln have 18 months of schooling?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the number of months Lincoln spent in school, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide a correct, accurate, or factual answer to the question. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Lincoln did have 18 months of schooling. The response instead states that there is no information provided, which is not aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the given score rubric.
[RESULT]: 1
