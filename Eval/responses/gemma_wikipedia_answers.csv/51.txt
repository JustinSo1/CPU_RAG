[PROMPT]: Did Abraham Lincoln live in the Frontier?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Abraham Lincoln's living environment, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes

Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the fact being asked. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
