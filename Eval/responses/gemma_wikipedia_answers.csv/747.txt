[PROMPT]: Who won the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering radioactivity ?
[USER_ANSWER]: Antoine Henri Becquerel won the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering radioactivity.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Henri Becquerel
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies Henri Becquerel as the winner of the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering radioactivity. However, the inclusion of "Antoine" as part of his name is unnecessary and not part of the reference answer. While it does not make the response incorrect, it adds an element that is not required. Therefore, the response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual, but not completely aligned with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
