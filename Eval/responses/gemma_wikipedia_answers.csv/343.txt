[PROMPT]: Is a drake a male?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the sex of a drake, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The question asks for a factual answer about the sex of a drake, and the correct answer is "Yes," as a drake is indeed a male duck. The response fails to provide this factual information and instead incorrectly states that the context does not provide information, which is irrelevant to the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
