[PROMPT]: Have larger kangaroos adapted much better to changes?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether larger kangaroos have adapted much better to changes wrought to the Australian landscape by humans, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that larger kangaroos have adapted much better to changes. The response provided does not address the question directly and instead states that there is no information available to answer the question, which is not accurate based on the reference answer.
