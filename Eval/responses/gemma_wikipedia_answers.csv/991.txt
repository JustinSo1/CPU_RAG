[PROMPT]: Have larger kangaroos adapted much better to changes?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether larger kangaroos have adapted much better to changes wrought to the Australian landscape by humans, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly acknowledges the lack of information in the context and refrains from providing an answer based on that limitation. It does not make any inaccurate claims or assumptions.
[RESULT]: 5
