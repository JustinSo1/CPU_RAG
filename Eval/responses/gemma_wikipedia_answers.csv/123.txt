[PROMPT]: Did the scientific community not reserve great attention to his theory ?
[USER_ANSWER]: No, the context does not provide any information about the scientific community's reserve towards Isaac Newton's theory of light.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the scientific community did not reserve great attention to the theory. The evaluated response, however, states that the context does not provide information about the scientific community's reserve towards Isaac Newton's theory of light, which contradicts the reference answer. Therefore, the response does not align well with the reference answer and lacks accuracy.
[RESULT]: 2
