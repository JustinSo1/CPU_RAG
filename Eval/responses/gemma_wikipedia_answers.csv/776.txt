[PROMPT]: Is Indonesia a republic?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Indonesia is a republic, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question of whether Indonesia is a republic. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information needed to answer the question. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "yes." The response fails to provide the correct, accurate, and factual information required.
[RESULT]: 1
