[PROMPT]: Is Canada's official language Zulu?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Canada's official language Zulu, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether Zulu is Canada's official language. Instead, it deflects by stating that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the question. The correct and factual answer is simply "No," as Zulu is not an official language of Canada. Therefore, the response is not accurate or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
