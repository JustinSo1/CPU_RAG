[PROMPT]: Is Canada's official language Zulu?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about Canada's official language Zulu, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that Canada's official language is not Zulu based on the reference answer provided. However, it does not explicitly state the answer "No" as in the reference answer, which slightly affects the accuracy of the response.
