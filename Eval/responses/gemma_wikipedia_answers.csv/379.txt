[PROMPT]: Are ducks an accepted presence in some populated areas?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the context indicates that ducks are an accepted presence in some populated areas during the winter months.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct and accurate, as it acknowledges that ducks are an accepted presence in some populated areas. However, it adds unnecessary context about the winter months, which is not mentioned in the reference answer. This additional detail makes the response less precise and deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
