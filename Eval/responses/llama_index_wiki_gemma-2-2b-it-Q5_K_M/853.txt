[PROMPT]: Is Uruguay located in the northwesten part of Africa?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
No. 
Explanation: The provided context information states that Uruguay is located in the Americas, specifically in South America. It does not mention anything about its location in Africa. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is correct in stating that Uruguay is not located in the northwestern part of Africa. However, the additional explanation provided is unnecessary and slightly deviates from the simplicity of the reference answer. The reference answer is concise and to the point, while the response includes extra information that, although accurate, is not required. This makes the response mostly correct, accurate, and factual, but not completely aligned with the reference answer's simplicity.
[RESULT]: 4
