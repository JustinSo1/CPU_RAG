[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Qatar
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual. None of the countries listed in the response actually border Saudi Arabia. The correct answer, as indicated in the reference answer, is Qatar. Other correct answers would include countries like Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. The response lists countries that are not even in the same region, such as Canada, Australia, and Switzerland, which makes the response entirely inaccurate.
