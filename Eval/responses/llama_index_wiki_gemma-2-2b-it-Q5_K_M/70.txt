[PROMPT]: When are sperm cells transferred to the female?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text states that the lentivirally transduced mouse spermatozoa were used in in vitro fertilization (IVF) studies, and when followed by embryo transfer, â‰¥ 42% of founders were found to be transgenic for GFP. 
This implies that sperm cells are transferred to the female during the IVF process. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: during pairing
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that sperm cells are transferred to the female during pairing, which is a natural process. The response, however, discusses an in vitro fertilization (IVF) process involving lentivirally transduced mouse spermatozoa and embryo transfer, which is not relevant to the natural transfer of sperm cells to the female. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual in the context of the given instruction.
[RESULT]: 1
