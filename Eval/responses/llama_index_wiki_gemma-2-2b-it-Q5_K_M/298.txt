[PROMPT]: Why do wolves howl?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about why wolves howl. 
It focuses on ultrasonic vocalizations in mice, the role of ProSAP1/Shank2 in communication, and the physiological response to stress in various organisms. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Howling helps pack members keep in touch, allowing them to communicate effectively in thickly forested areas or over great distances. Howling also helps to call pack members to a specific location. Howling can also serve as a declaration of territory, as shown in a dominant wolf&apos;s tendency to respond to a human imitation of a "rival" wolf in an area the wolf considers its own. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and does not address the question of why wolves howl. Instead, it discusses unrelated topics such as ultrasonic vocalizations in mice, the role of ProSAP1/Shank2 in communication, and physiological responses to stress in various organisms. This information is not relevant to the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
