[PROMPT]: What was more damaging than moving students into colleges?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not explicitly state that moving students into colleges was more damaging than other actions.  It focuses on:

* **The impact of teaching hospitals and hospital size on healthcare costs.**
* **The differences between MIS-C and KD.**
* **The influence of medical school and residency experiences on academic careers.**
* **The importance of chest protection in sports.**

Therefore, based on the provided text, we cannot determine what was more damaging than moving students into colleges. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: His confrontation with Andrew Fleming West
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and instead discusses unrelated topics such as healthcare costs, differences between MIS-C and KD, medical school experiences, and chest protection in sports. It fails to identify "His confrontation with Andrew Fleming West" as the more damaging event, which is the correct and factual answer based on the reference. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and inaccurate.
[RESULT]: 1
