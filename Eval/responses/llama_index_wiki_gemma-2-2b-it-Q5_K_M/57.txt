[PROMPT]: Are beetles insects?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Yes, the context information explicitly states that "Beetles can cause vesicular dermatitis via cantharidin or paederin." 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges beetles, but it introduces unnecessary and unrelated information about vesicular dermatitis and cantharidin or paederin, which is not relevant to the question of whether beetles are insects. The response does not directly answer the question in a clear and concise manner as the reference answer does. Therefore, it lacks the complete accuracy and factuality required for a higher score.
[RESULT]: 3
