[PROMPT]: Is Egypt the most populated country in Africa?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided context information, we cannot determine if Egypt is the most populated country in Africa. 
The text does not provide any information about the population of Egypt or any other African country. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of information provided to determine if Egypt is the most populated country in Africa. However, it does not directly answer the question with a simple "no," which is the correct and factual response according to the reference answer. The response overcomplicates the answer by discussing the lack of context rather than providing the straightforward factual answer required.
[RESULT]: 3
