[PROMPT]: Is uruguay's landscape mountainous?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not explicitly state whether Uruguay's landscape is mountainous. 
However, it does mention that Uruguay has a low rate of miscegenation and no remaining isolated Amerindian groups. This suggests that Uruguay's landscape is likely not heavily mountainous. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "No," indicating that Uruguay's landscape is not mountainous. The response, however, does not directly answer the question and instead provides unrelated information about miscegenation and Amerindian groups, which does not pertain to the landscape of Uruguay. Therefore, the response fails to address the question accurately and factually.
[RESULT]: 1
