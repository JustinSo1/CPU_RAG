[PROMPT]: Is there a becquerel crater on the moon and a becquerel crater on mars?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided context information does not contain any information about the presence of craters on the moon or Mars. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about the presence of Becquerel craters on the moon and Mars. Instead, it mentions the lack of context information, which is not relevant to the question. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the existence of Becquerel craters on both celestial bodies. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
