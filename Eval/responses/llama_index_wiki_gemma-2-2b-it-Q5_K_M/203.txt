[PROMPT]: Is an elephant's skin tough?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided context, we can infer that elephant skin is likely tough. 

Here's why:

* **Collagen's role:** The text mentions collagen as the most abundant protein in the body, providing tensile strength to tissues. 
* **Elephant skin's composition:** Elephants have thick skin, which suggests a need for strong and durable material. 
* **Toughness and elasticity:** The text describes how collagen contributes to the toughness and elasticity of tissues. 

Therefore, based on the context, we can conclude that elephant skin is likely tough and strong. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation about why elephant skin is tough, referencing the role of collagen and the composition of elephant skin. However, the reference answer is a simple "yes," which is completely correct and factual. The response, while accurate, is more elaborate than necessary and does not directly answer the question as succinctly as the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
