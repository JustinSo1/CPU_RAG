[PROMPT]: How long after the death of his first wife did Fillmore marry Caroline McIntosh?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about Fillmore's first wife's death or his subsequent marriage to Caroline McIntosh. Therefore, I cannot answer the query. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: where is the death date of his first wife?
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of information needed to answer the question. However, it does not directly ask for the missing information, as the reference answer does. The reference answer seeks the specific missing detail (the death date of Fillmore's first wife), which is a more accurate and factual approach to addressing the query. The evaluated response is more general and does not directly address the missing information in the same way.
[RESULT]: 3
