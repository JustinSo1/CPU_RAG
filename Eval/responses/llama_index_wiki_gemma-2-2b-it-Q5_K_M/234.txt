[PROMPT]: What is Finland's economy like?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about the Finnish economy. 
It focuses on genetics, health, and demographics. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: a highly industrialised, free-market economy
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question about Finland's economy at all. Instead, it mentions unrelated topics such as genetics, health, and demographics. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which describes Finland's economy as highly industrialised and free-market.
[RESULT]: 1
