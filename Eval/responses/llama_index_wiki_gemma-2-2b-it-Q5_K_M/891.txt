[PROMPT]: Did Woodrow Wilson create the League of Nations?

The response provided not only gives the wrong answer but also includes an irrelevant explanation about the history of the polio vaccine and Johann Gregor Mendel, which has no connection to the question asked. This makes the response entirely off-topic and factually incorrect.
