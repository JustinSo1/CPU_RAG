[PROMPT]: Did the Department of the Interior not charge that the rights of way for this land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided text, there is no information about the Department of the Interior, railroads, rights of way, or agreements related to land use. Therefore, I cannot answer your query. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question posed in the instruction. Instead, it states that there is no information available to answer the query, which is not accurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the Department of the Interior did charge that the rights of way for the land must be returned to the public. The response fails to provide this information and is therefore not correct, accurate, or factual.
[RESULT]: 1
