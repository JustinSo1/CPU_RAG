[PROMPT]: Is the Romanian economy doing well?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about the Romanian economy. 
It focuses on medical research, particularly on the effectiveness of a drug called tofacitinib. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question about the Romanian economy at all. Instead, it discusses an unrelated topic about medical research and a drug called tofacitinib. This makes the response completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer, which simply states "Yes" to indicate the Romanian economy is doing well.
[RESULT]: 1
