[PROMPT]: Did the team , sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide -LRB- laughing gas -RRB- , not remove his upper left jaw and portions of his hard palate ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about a patient named Cleveland or any surgical procedures performed on him. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The instruction asks a yes/no question about a specific surgical procedure performed on a patient named Cleveland. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the procedure did occur. However, the response provided does not address the question at all and instead states that the text does not contain information about Cleveland or any surgical procedures, which is not relevant to the instruction.
[RESULT]: 1
