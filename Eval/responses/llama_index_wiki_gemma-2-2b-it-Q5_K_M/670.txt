[PROMPT]: What insulate it against the cold?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text discusses the mechanisms of cold resistance in various organisms, including:

* **Soil springtails:** They have cold acclimation mechanisms, including increased glycerol, decreased fucose and glucose, and production of antifreeze proteins (AFP).
* **Winter flounder:** They have two types of antifreeze proteins, liver-type and skin-type, with the skin-type lacking complete ice-binding motifs.
* **Brown fat tissue in humans:** It is involved in thermogenesis and is more active in cold conditions.

The text suggests that these mechanisms, including antifreeze proteins, help organisms survive and function in cold environments. 

Therefore, the answer to your query is that **antifreeze proteins** insulate organisms against the cold. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Its think blubber and fur.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is not aligned with the reference answer. The reference answer indicates that "blubber and fur" are the insulators against the cold, while the response discusses antifreeze proteins and other mechanisms in various organisms. Although the response is detailed and factual about cold resistance mechanisms, it does not directly address the specific insulators mentioned in the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect in the context of the given rubric.
[RESULT]: 2
