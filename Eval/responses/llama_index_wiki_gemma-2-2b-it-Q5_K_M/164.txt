[PROMPT]: How does a Mallard's tongue work?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about how a Mallard's tongue works. 
It focuses on the structure and function of the masseter muscle in birds, particularly the takin, giraffe, and Sika deer. 
It also discusses the mandibular organ in the silky anteater and burning mouth syndrome. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: It's tongue is a flat plate, and on the tongue's back end is a short liftable flap with about 18 short spikes for pushing struggling prey and other food down its throat
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and does not provide any information about how a Mallard's tongue works. Instead, it discusses unrelated topics such as the masseter muscle in various animals and the mandibular organ in the silky anteater. This does not align with the reference answer, which describes the structure and function of a Mallard's tongue.
[RESULT]: 1
