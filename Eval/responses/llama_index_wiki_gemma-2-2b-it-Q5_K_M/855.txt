[PROMPT]: Does Uruguay have cold summers?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text discusses the prevalence of cystic fibrosis in Uruguay and mentions that the "hypothermic" or "cold syndrome (cold injury)" is a disorder affecting inadequately protected infants in severely cold seasons. 
It also mentions that the "probing" of H. halys occurs at temperatures between 3.5 and 6.1 °C and that 'probing' does not occur at temperatures above 26.5 to 29.6 °C. 
Based on this information, we can infer that Uruguay likely has **mild** summers. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided does not directly answer the question "Does Uruguay have cold summers?" Instead, it discusses unrelated topics such as cystic fibrosis and the behavior of H. halys at various temperatures. The information given does not address the climate of Uruguay or provide a clear answer to the question. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which is a simple "No."
[RESULT]: 1
