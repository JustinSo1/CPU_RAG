* **Current cell phone subscriptions in Finland:**  The text does not mention the number of cell phone subscriptions in Finland or any other country.
* **Population size of Finland:** The text does not provide any data on the population of Finland. 


To answer your query, you would need to find data on cell phone subscriptions in Finland and the population of Finland.

The response provided, however, states that the information cannot be determined from the text, which is not aligned with the reference answer. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not provide the factual information required.
