[PROMPT]: Is an official language of Canada German?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
No. 
The context information states that the German version of the text is suitable for evaluation of facial palsies in clinical routine and studies to allow a better comparability of German patients with results of the international literature. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No.
[FEEDBACK]: The response starts with the correct answer "No," which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional context information about the German version of the text being suitable for evaluation of facial palsies is irrelevant to the question about the official language of Canada. This extra information does not contribute to the accuracy or factual correctness of the response and could potentially confuse the reader. Therefore, while the initial answer is correct, the additional context detracts from the overall quality of the response.
[RESULT]: 3
