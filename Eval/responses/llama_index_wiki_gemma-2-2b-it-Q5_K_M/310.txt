[PROMPT]: Was Grover Cleveland born in New York?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about Grover Cleveland's birth place. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it does not provide incorrect information, but it does not directly answer the question. The reference answer is a simple "no," which is a direct and factual response. The evaluated response, however, states that the provided text does not contain information about Grover Cleveland's birthplace, which is not the same as directly answering the question. Therefore, it lacks the directness and completeness required for a higher score.
[RESULT]: 3
