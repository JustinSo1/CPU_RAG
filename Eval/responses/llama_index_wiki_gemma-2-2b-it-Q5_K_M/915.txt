[PROMPT]: Did he not cast his ballot for John M. Palmer , the presidential candidate of the National Democratic Party , or Gold Democrats , a short-lived party that supported a gold standard , low tariffs , and limited government ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about Scott's voting preferences or political affiliations. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question posed in the instruction. The question asks whether "he" cast his ballot for John M. Palmer, which requires a simple "yes" or "no" answer. The response instead comments on the lack of information about Scott's voting preferences or political affiliations, which is not relevant to the question. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
