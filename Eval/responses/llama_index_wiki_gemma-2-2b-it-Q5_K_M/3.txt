[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it indicates the provided text does not contain information about the patient's mother or her cause of death. However, it does not directly answer the question "Did his mother die of pneumonia?" with a simple "no," which is the expected response based on the reference answer. The response is more elaborate than necessary and does not directly address the question.
