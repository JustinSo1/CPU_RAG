[PROMPT]: Are elephants mammals?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Yes, the text states that elephants are included in the first-diverging placental mammal lineage. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It correctly identifies that elephants are mammals, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional detail about "the first-diverging placental mammal lineage" is not necessary and could potentially confuse the reader, as it is not directly relevant to the simple question of whether elephants are mammals. This extra information makes the response slightly less straightforward than the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 4
