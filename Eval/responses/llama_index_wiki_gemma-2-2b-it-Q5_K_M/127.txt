[PROMPT]: What is Canada's national unemployment rate?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about Canada's national unemployment rate. 
It focuses on a study about the impact of depression and economic hardship on caregivers of patients with neurological conditions. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: While as of October 2007, Canada's national unemployment rate of 5.9% is its lowest in 33 years. Provincial unemployment rates vary from a low of 3.6% in Alberta to a high of 14.6% in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any information about Canada's national unemployment rate, which is the main focus of the instruction. Instead, it discusses an unrelated topic about a study on depression and economic hardship among caregivers. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
