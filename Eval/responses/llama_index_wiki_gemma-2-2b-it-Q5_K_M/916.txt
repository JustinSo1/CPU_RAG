[PROMPT]: Did Wilson not spend 1914 through the beginning of 1917 trying to keep America out of the war in Europe ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about Woodrow Wilson or his actions during World War I. Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about Woodrow Wilson's actions during World War I. Instead, it states that the provided text does not contain information about Wilson, which is not relevant to the question asked. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that Wilson did try to keep America out of the war during that period. The response fails to address this and is therefore not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
