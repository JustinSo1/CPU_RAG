[PROMPT]: Are penguins considered "higher waterbirds"?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided context, the answer is **yes**. 

Here's why:

* **"Monophyletic waterbird and landbird clades"**: This suggests a classification system that groups birds based on evolutionary relationships, with penguins belonging to a waterbird clade.
* **"Waterbirds"**: The text specifically mentions "waterbirds" as a clade. 
* **"Higher waterbirds"**: The text doesn't explicitly define "higher waterbirds," but it implies a hierarchy within the waterbird clade.


Let me know if you have any other questions!
