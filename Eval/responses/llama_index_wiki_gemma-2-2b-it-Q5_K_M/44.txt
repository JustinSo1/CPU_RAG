[PROMPT]: Is it true that he published a collection in 1738?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not mention anything about a publication in 1738. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it addresses the lack of information about a publication in 1738. However, it is not as concise and direct as the reference answer. The reference answer simply states "No," which is a clear and factual response to the question. The evaluated response adds unnecessary information about the provided text, which is not required by the instruction. Therefore, while the response is accurate, it is not as precise as it could be.
[RESULT]: 4
