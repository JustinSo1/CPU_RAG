[PROMPT]: Does snow fall in Egypt?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided text, we can infer that snow falls in Egypt. 
The text mentions that a body was found in the Andes, and the hypothesis is that the body was covered by snow and ice, and then underwent thawing and, finally, desiccation. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and not factual. The provided text does not relate to the question about snow falling in Egypt. Instead, it discusses a body found in the Andes, which is irrelevant to the question. The correct answer is simply "Yes," indicating that snow does fall in Egypt, albeit rarely. The response fails to address the question accurately or factually.
[RESULT]: 1
