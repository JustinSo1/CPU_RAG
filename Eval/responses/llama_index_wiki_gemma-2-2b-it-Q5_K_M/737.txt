[PROMPT]: Did Singapore's standard of living decrease since independence?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about Singapore's standard of living since independence. 
It focuses on dengue resurgence and the impact of expats on health outcomes. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No, the standard living was raised.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question about Singapore's standard of living since independence. Instead, it mentions unrelated topics such as dengue resurgence and the impact of expats on health outcomes. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer, which clearly states that the standard of living was raised.
[RESULT]: 1
