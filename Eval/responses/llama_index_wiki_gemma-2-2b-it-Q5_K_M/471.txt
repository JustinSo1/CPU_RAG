[PROMPT]: What are four species that are commonly referred to as kangaroos?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
1. Wallaroos (Macropus robustus robustus)
2. Euros (M.r.erubescens)
3. Red kangaroos (M. rufus)
4. Inland robust scorpion (Urodacus yaschenkoi) 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The Red Kangaroo, The Eastern Grey Kangaroo, The Western Grey Kangaroo, and The Antilopine Kangaroo
[FEEDBACK]: The response includes three species that are commonly referred to as kangaroos: Wallaroos, Euros, and Red kangaroos. However, the fourth species listed, the Inland robust scorpion, is not a kangaroo species and is completely incorrect. This makes the response mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
