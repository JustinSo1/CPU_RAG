* The Iceman and his musculoskeletal conditions
* Tick monitoring in Alaska 


The text does not contain any information about Abraham Lincoln or his life. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that Abraham Lincoln did live in the Frontier. The response not only denies this fact but also includes irrelevant information about anthrax outbreaks, chronic wasting disease, tick species, and other unrelated topics. This demonstrates a lack of understanding and accuracy regarding the question asked.
