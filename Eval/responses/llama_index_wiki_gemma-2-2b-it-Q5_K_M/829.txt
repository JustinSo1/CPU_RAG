[PROMPT]: Does the Order Testudines not include both extant -LRB- living -RRB- and extinct species , the earliest known turtles being from around 215 million years ago ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not explicitly state whether the Order Testudines includes both extant and extinct species. 
It does, however, mention that the earliest known turtles date back to around 215 million years ago. 
It also states that the phylogenetic position of turtles has been a subject of debate, with some studies placing them at the base of the reptile tree and others placing them with lizards, snakes, and tuatara. 
It also mentions that the study focused on a comparative analysis of a new set of expressed genes of the red-eared slider turtle and orthologs of the turtle genes in mammalian, archosaurian, and amphibian genomes. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question posed in the instruction. The question asks whether the Order Testudines includes both extant and extinct species, and the reference answer is a simple "yes." The response, however, provides additional information about the earliest known turtles, the phylogenetic position of turtles, and a study on turtle genes, none of which directly address the question. Therefore, the response is not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
