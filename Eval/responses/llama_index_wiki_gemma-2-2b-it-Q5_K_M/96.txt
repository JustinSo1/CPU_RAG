[PROMPT]: Was Coolidge the thirteenth President of the United States?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
No. 
---------------------
Explanation: 
The provided text discusses the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and its immunogenicity and tolerability profile. It does not mention anything about Calvin Coolidge, the 30th President of the United States. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that Coolidge was not the thirteenth President of the United States, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional explanation provided is irrelevant and does not pertain to the question asked. The explanation about the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is unrelated to the topic of U.S. Presidents and does not contribute to the accuracy of the response. Therefore, while the initial "No" is correct, the extraneous information detracts from the overall quality of the response.
[RESULT]: 4
