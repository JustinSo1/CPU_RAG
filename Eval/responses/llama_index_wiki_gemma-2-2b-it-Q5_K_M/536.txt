[PROMPT]: Does the state court rule on the conformity of laws?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
No. 
Explanation: The provided text discusses the approval of thalidomide for patients with serious conditions, highlighting the need for continuous vigilance to prevent teratogenic disasters. It does not mention anything about state court rulings on the conformity of laws. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states "Yes," indicating that state courts do rule on the conformity of laws. The response provided not only gives an incorrect answer ("No") but also includes an irrelevant explanation about thalidomide, which does not pertain to the question asked. Therefore, the response fails to meet the criteria for correctness, accuracy, and factuality.
[RESULT]: 1
