[PROMPT]: What expression is part of a conceptual framework for testing computer systems?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain the answer to your query. 
The text focuses on:
* **Biomedical research:** Identifying and validating disease genes.
* **Clinical diagnostics:** Using a cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test for melanoma treatment.
* **LINCS assays:** Annotating cell lines, proteins, and small molecules with metadata. 


Let me know if you have any other questions. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Quacks like a duck
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question about an expression that is part of a conceptual framework for testing computer systems. Instead, it discusses unrelated topics such as biomedical research, clinical diagnostics, and LINCS assays. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual in relation to the given instruction and reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
