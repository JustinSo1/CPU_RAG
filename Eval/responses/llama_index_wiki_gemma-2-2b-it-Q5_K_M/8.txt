[PROMPT]: When did the Gettysburg address argue that America was born?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The Gettysburg Address did not argue that America was born. 
The Gettysburg Address was delivered in 1863, during the American Civil War. 
It focuses on the importance of preserving the Union and honoring the sacrifices made by soldiers who died at Gettysburg. 
The address does not discuss the founding of the United States or the concept of America being born. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1776
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate. The Gettysburg Address does indeed reference the birth of America, specifically mentioning "four score and seven years ago," which points to the year 1776, the year of the Declaration of Independence. The response fails to acknowledge this key aspect and instead focuses on other elements of the speech. While it is true that the address was delivered in 1863 and emphasizes the preservation of the Union and honoring fallen soldiers, it inaccurately claims that the address does not discuss the founding of the United States.
[RESULT]: 2
