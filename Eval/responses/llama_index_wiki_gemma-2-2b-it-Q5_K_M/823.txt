[PROMPT]: These projections , called papillae , have what?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text describes that the unipolar brush cell (UBC) has projections called papillae. These papillae are characterized by a single dendrite that terminates with a brush-like tip of dendrioles. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: a rich blood supply
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer states that the papillae have "a rich blood supply," while the response discusses unipolar brush cells and their dendritic structures, which is unrelated to the given instruction.
[RESULT]: 1
