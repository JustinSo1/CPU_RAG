[PROMPT]: Why did Grant say "Damn, I had nothing to do with this batte."?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain any information about Grant, a "bate," or any context that would allow for an answer to this query. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: It went well.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual. The reference answer indicates that the response should be "It went well," which is a simple and direct statement. The evaluated response, however, does not address the question at all and instead mentions the lack of context in the provided text, which is irrelevant to the task.
[RESULT]: 1
