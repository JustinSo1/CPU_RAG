[PROMPT]: Is the leopard smaller than the other members of Panthera?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided context, we cannot determine if the leopard is smaller than other members of the Panthera genus. 

**Explanation:**

The provided text focuses on:

* **Tiger anatomy:** Describing the normal appearance of the stifle joint using MRI and anatomical dissections.
* **Genetic analysis:** Investigating the tyrosinase gene in gorillas and humans, and the genetic basis of tortoiseshell coat color in a tomcat.
* **Phylogenetics:** Exploring the evolutionary relationships between placental mammals, including elephants, tenrecs, and bats.
* **Computational tools:** Introducing PANTHER-PSEP, a tool for predicting pathogenic human variants. 

There is no information about the size of leopards compared to other members of the Panthera genus. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer simply states "yes," indicating that the leopard is indeed smaller than other members of the Panthera genus. The response provided goes into unnecessary detail about unrelated topics and ultimately concludes that the information cannot be determined from the context, which is incorrect. The response does not align with the reference answer and fails to provide the correct information.
[RESULT]: 1
