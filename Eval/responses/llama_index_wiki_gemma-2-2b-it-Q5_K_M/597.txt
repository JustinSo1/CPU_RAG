[PROMPT]: Why otters are considered as totem animals?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about otters or their significance as totem animals. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The time of year associated with this is also associated with the Aquarius sign of the Zodiac, through which the sun passes January 20-February 19. 
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question about why otters are considered totem animals. It states that the provided text does not contain information about otters, which is not relevant to the instruction. The reference answer, while not directly addressing the question either, at least provides some related information about the time of year and zodiac sign. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
