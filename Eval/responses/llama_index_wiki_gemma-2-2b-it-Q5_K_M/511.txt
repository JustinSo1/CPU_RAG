[PROMPT]: Is the black color heritable and caused by only one recessive gene locus ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
No. 
Explanation: 
The provided text states that the dominant black coat color in Holstein dairy cattle is controlled by the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. It also mentions that the Dominant Red coat color in Holstein dairy cattle is caused by a mutation in the coatomer protein complex, subunit alpha (COPA) gene. 
The text also states that the genetics of albinism are complex and that 12 different genes have been identified that, when mutated, result in a different type of albinism. 
Therefore, the black color in Holstein dairy cattle is not caused by only one recessive gene locus. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer simply states "Yes," indicating that the black color is heritable and caused by only one recessive gene locus. However, the response provided argues against this, stating that the black color in Holstein dairy cattle is not caused by only one recessive gene locus and provides additional information about other genes related to coat color and albinism, which is not relevant to the question. Therefore, the response does not align with the reference answer and is mostly incorrect.
[RESULT]: 2
