[PROMPT]: Is it not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic lineage , or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about palaeeudyptines or anthropornithinae. Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: It is not even known.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided does not directly address the question. Instead, it states that the text does not contain information about palaeeudyptines or anthropornithinae, which is not accurate. The question is asking about the uncertainty regarding the monophyletic lineage of the gigantic palaeeudyptines or the independent evolution of gigantism in Palaeeudyptinae and Anthropornithinae. The reference answer succinctly captures this uncertainty with "It is not even known." Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
