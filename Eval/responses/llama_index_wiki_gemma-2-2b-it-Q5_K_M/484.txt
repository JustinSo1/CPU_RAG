[PROMPT]: Is a leopard larger and less lanky than a cheetah?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about the size or lanky nature of leopards or cheetahs. Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and instead states that the provided text does not contain the necessary information. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm that a leopard is larger and less lanky than a cheetah. The evaluated response fails to provide this information and is therefore completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
