[PROMPT]: Is Pencak Silat an Indonesian martial art ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided context information, we can't definitively say whether Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art. 

Here's why:

* **Focus on Commotio Cordis:** The text primarily discusses commotio cordis, a sudden cardiac death caused by blunt chest trauma. It mentions the Indonesian population and a mutation found in patients.
* **No Information on Pencak Silat:** The text doesn't provide any information about Pencak Silat, its origins, or its connection to Indonesia. 


To determine if Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art, you would need to consult sources specifically about Pencak Silat. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is not correct or accurate based on the reference answer. The question asks if Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art, and the correct answer is simply "yes." The response provided goes into unnecessary detail about unrelated topics and fails to address the question directly. It does not provide the correct information that Pencak Silat is indeed an Indonesian martial art. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being correct, accurate, and factual.
[RESULT]: 1
