[PROMPT]: Do wolf pups tend to have darker fur than adults?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided text, we can't definitively say whether wolf pups have darker fur than adults. 

Here's why:

* **Focus on human pigmentation:** The text primarily discusses human and animal pigmentation, particularly melanin production and related genes. 
* **No wolf fur information:** There's no mention of wolf fur color or its relation to age. 
* **Limited genetic context:** While the text touches on melanocortin receptor genes and their role in hair color, it doesn't provide information about wolf fur genetics. 


To answer your question about wolf pups and fur color, you would need to research wolf genetics and fur coloration specifically. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether wolf pups tend to have darker fur than adults. Instead, it focuses on the lack of information in the provided text and suggests further research. This makes the response mostly incorrect and not factual in relation to the reference answer, which is a straightforward "Yes." The response fails to provide the correct, accurate, and factual information required by the question.
[RESULT]: 2
