[PROMPT]: Are Canada 's official national sports ice hockey ( winter ) and lacrosse ( summer ) ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided text, we can conclude that:
* **Ice hockey** is a popular sport in Canada, as it is mentioned in the context information.
* **Lacrosse** is also mentioned as a popular sport in Canada.
* The text does not explicitly state that ice hockey and lacrosse are Canada's official national sports.


**Therefore, we cannot definitively answer the query based on the provided text.** 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the popularity of ice hockey and lacrosse in Canada. However, it fails to directly answer the question about whether these sports are the official national sports of Canada. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should be straightforward and affirmative. The evaluated response overcomplicates the answer and ultimately does not provide the correct information.
[RESULT]: 3
