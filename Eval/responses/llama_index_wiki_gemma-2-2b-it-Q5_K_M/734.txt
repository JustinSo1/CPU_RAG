[PROMPT]: Is romania -LRB- , -RRB- a country in southeastern europe?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Yes. 
The text states that the "Victor Babes" National Institute of Pathology Bucharest is located in Romania. 
---------------------

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. The initial "Yes" directly answers the question correctly. However, the additional information about the "Victor Babes" National Institute of Pathology Bucharest being located in Romania is unnecessary and does not directly address the question about Romania being a country in southeastern Europe. This extra information does not detract from the correctness of the response but is not needed to answer the question accurately.
[RESULT]: 4
