[PROMPT]: Was James Monroe President of the United States?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided context information, the answer is **yes**. 
---------------------
Explanation: 
The provided text mentions that "Government work and is in the public domain in the USA" and "Thomas Barlow described the classic clinical and pathologic features of infantile scurvy in 1883". 
This text does not mention anything about James Monroe. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that James Monroe was President of the United States, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the explanation provided is irrelevant and does not contribute to the accuracy of the response. The additional context about government work and infantile scurvy is unnecessary and detracts from the clarity of the answer. The response would be improved by simply stating "yes" without the extraneous information.
[RESULT]: 4
