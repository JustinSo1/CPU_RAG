[PROMPT]: Have Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise been known to leap in front of cars ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about kangaroos reacting to headlights or engine noise. Therefore, I cannot answer your query based on the given context. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about whether kangaroos have been known to leap in front of cars when dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise. Instead, it states that the provided text does not contain information about this behavior, which is not relevant to the instruction. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should affirm the behavior. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
