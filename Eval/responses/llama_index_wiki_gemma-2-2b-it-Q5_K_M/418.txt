[PROMPT]: Was Adams raised Congregationalist?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about John Adams's religious beliefs or upbringing. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and does not directly answer the question. The question asks whether Adams was raised Congregationalist, which can be answered with a simple "Yes" or "No." The response instead states that the provided text does not contain information about Adams's religious beliefs or upbringing, which is not relevant to the accuracy of the answer to the question. Therefore, the response does not align well with the reference answer and lacks the necessary factual accuracy.
[RESULT]: 2
