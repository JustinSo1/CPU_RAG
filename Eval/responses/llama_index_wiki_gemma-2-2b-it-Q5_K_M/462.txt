[PROMPT]: Is a Kangaroo a Marsupial?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Yes. The text states: "The sequencing of the kangaroo genome provides an opportunity to use comparative analyses to compare the HOX clusters of a mammal with a distinct body plan to those of other mammals." 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that a kangaroo is a marsupial, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional text provided about the kangaroo genome and HOX clusters is irrelevant to the question and does not contribute to the accuracy of the response. The inclusion of this extraneous information makes the response less concise and focused than the reference answer. While the core information is correct, the additional details do not enhance the response and could potentially confuse the reader.
[RESULT]: 4
