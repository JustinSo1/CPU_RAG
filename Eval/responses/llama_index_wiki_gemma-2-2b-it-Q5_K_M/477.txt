[PROMPT]: Is a collision with a vehicle capable of killing a kangaroo ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided context, it is impossible to determine if a collision with a vehicle could kill a kangaroo. 

Here's why:

* **Focus on Human Injuries:** The provided information focuses on human injuries and deaths in car collisions. 
* **No Kangaroo Data:** There is no mention of kangaroo physiology, their susceptibility to blunt force trauma, or their vulnerability to vehicle collisions. 
* **Commotio Cordis:** The context discusses commotio cordis, a phenomenon where a sudden blow to the chest can cause ventricular fibrillation and death. This is relevant to humans, but not to kangaroos. 


To answer your query about kangaroos and vehicle collisions, you would need to research:

* **Kangaroo Anatomy:**  Their size, bone structure, and muscle mass.
* **Kangaroo Physiology:** Their heart rate, blood pressure, and vulnerability to injury.
* **Kangaroo Behavior:** Their tendency to run, their reaction to sudden impacts, and their susceptibility to injuries from vehicles. 
* **Vehicle Impact:** The force of a vehicle collision, the potential for crushing, and the likelihood of internal injuries. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided is not aligned with the reference answer, which is a simple "yes." The response goes into detail about the lack of information in the provided context and suggests areas for further research, but it does not directly answer the question. This makes the response mostly incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
