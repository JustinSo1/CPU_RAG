[PROMPT]: Is English the official language?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided context information, we can't definitively say whether English is the official language of the country. 
The text mentions "The PIE system utilizes natural language processing techniques and machine learning methodologies to predict PPI sentences, which results in high precision performance for Web users." 
This suggests that the country has a focus on technology and possibly English is used in that context. 
However, the text does not explicitly state whether English is the official language. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it acknowledges the lack of explicit information about English being the official language. However, it overcomplicates the answer by discussing unrelated context about technology and natural language processing, which is not relevant to the question. The reference answer is a simple "yes," indicating that the correct response should be straightforward and definitive. The evaluated response fails to provide a clear and direct answer, making it only somewhat accurate and factual.
[RESULT]: 3
