[PROMPT]: When did he vote for democrat james buchanan?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain any information about Johann Gregor Mendel voting for James Buchanan. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: 1856
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question directly and does not provide the correct year (1856) when James Buchanan was voted for. Instead, it mentions Johann Gregor Mendel, who is unrelated to the question. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
