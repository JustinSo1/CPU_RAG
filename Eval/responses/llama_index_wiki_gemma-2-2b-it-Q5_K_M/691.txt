[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual. It does not address the question about what carried a tacit recognition of Qatar's status as distinct from Bahrain. The reference answer provides specific historical context involving the British Protectorate and the 1820 Anglo-Bahraini Treaty, which is not mentioned or alluded to in the response.
[RESULT]: 1
