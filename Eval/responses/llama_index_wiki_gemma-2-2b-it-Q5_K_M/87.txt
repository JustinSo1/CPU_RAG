[PROMPT]: Was Calvin Coolidge the twenty-ninth vice president?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
No. 
Explanation: The provided text does not mention Calvin Coolidge. It discusses the history of polio vaccines and the use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that Calvin Coolidge was not the twenty-ninth vice president, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional explanation provided is irrelevant and incorrect, as it discusses polio vaccines, which are unrelated to the question about Calvin Coolidge. This additional information detracts from the accuracy and relevance of the response.
[RESULT]: 3
