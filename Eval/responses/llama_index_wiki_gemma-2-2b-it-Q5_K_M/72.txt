[PROMPT]: Is it possible that there are more than 350,000 species of beetles?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided context, it is **not possible to definitively say** if there are more than 350,000 species of beetles. 

Here's why:

* **Focus on diversity:** The context focuses on the diversity of beetles, particularly in the genus *Cicindela* and the *Eupholini* (smurf-weevils). 
* **Limited data:** The provided text mentions the diversity of beetles but doesn't provide any specific data on the total number of species.
* **Other studies:** The context mentions that efforts to document species diversity and distribution ranges are still ongoing, suggesting that the total number of beetle species is likely much higher than what is currently known.


**To answer the query, we would need additional information on the total number of beetle species identified and estimated.** 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it discusses the diversity of beetles and the ongoing efforts to document species diversity. However, it fails to directly answer the question with a definitive "yes" or "no" as the reference answer does. The reference answer is clear and concise, stating "yes," which is the expected response. The evaluated response provides context and reasoning but ultimately does not align with the reference answer's directness and certainty. Therefore, it is not completely correct or accurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 3
