[PROMPT]: What do fossil and DNA evidence tell us?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
This passage discusses the use of DNA and fossil evidence to understand human evolution and the potential for predicting physical appearance from DNA. 

Here's what we learn from the evidence:

* **DNA evidence can be unreliable:**  While DNA can be used to infer evolutionary relationships, it can also be prone to errors and biases. For example, the presence of DNA in fossil samples doesn't always mean the organism was actually present during the time period suggested by the fossil.
* **Fossil and DNA evidence are complementary:**  Fossil evidence provides a physical record of past life, while DNA evidence provides a genetic record. Together, they can help us understand the history of life on Earth.
* **DNA can be used to predict physical appearance:**  Researchers are developing techniques to predict an individual's physical appearance from DNA alone. This is a complex and controversial field, but it has the potential to revolutionize forensic science and our understanding of human evolution.

The passage also highlights the importance of using appropriate statistical methods and considering the limitations of DNA evidence when interpreting results. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The polar bear diverged from the brown bear about 200 thousand years ago.
[FEEDBACK]: The response provided does not address the specific information given in the reference answer, which is about the divergence of the polar bear from the brown bear 200 thousand years ago. Instead, the response discusses the general use of DNA and fossil evidence in understanding human evolution and predicting physical appearance. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
