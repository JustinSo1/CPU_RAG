[PROMPT]: Did he not determine the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure -LRB- in excellent agreement with modern data -RRB- ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not mention anything about the boiling point of water and atmospheric pressure. Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot answer the query. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes he did
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question. Instead, it states that the provided text does not mention anything about the boiling point of water and atmospheric pressure, which is not relevant to the instruction. The reference answer is a simple "Yes he did," which directly addresses the question. Therefore, the response is mostly incorrect and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
