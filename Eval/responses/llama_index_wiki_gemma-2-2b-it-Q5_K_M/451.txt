[PROMPT]: What do kangaroos use for "crawl-walking?"
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about kangaroos using "crawl-walking." 
It focuses on the following topics:
* Comparative analysis of HOX gene clusters between a kangaroo and other mammals.
* The distribution and diversity of ticks in Australia.
* The spread of Burkholderia pseudomallei in Australia.
* The arm postures of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
* Footprints and their characteristic features.
* Idiopathic toe-walking in children. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: its hind feet
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question about what kangaroos use for "crawl-walking." Instead, it lists unrelated topics such as HOX gene clusters, ticks, Burkholderia pseudomallei, spinal muscular atrophy, footprints, and idiopathic toe-walking in children. This makes the response completely incorrect and not factual in relation to the question asked.
[RESULT]: 1
