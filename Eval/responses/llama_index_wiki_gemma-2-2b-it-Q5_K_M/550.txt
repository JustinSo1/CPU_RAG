[PROMPT]: Was the arrival of Louis Kossuth (exiled leader of a failed Hungarian revolution) another issue that presented itself during Fillmore's presidency?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
No. 
---------------------
Explanation: 
The provided text focuses on Gregor Mendel's life and scientific pursuits during the 19th century. It does not mention Louis Kossuth or his arrival in the United States. Therefore, the query about Louis Kossuth is irrelevant to the context. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is completely incorrect and inaccurate. The question asks whether the arrival of Louis Kossuth was an issue during Fillmore's presidency, and the correct answer is "Yes." The response provided not only gives the wrong answer but also includes an irrelevant explanation about Gregor Mendel, which has no connection to the question asked. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of the historical context and the specific query.
[RESULT]: 1
