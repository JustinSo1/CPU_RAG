[PROMPT]: Has it been created with a long term perspective to support the development of Qatar and the wider region , develop local and regional markets , and strengthen the links between the energy based economies and global financial markets ?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not explicitly mention the creation of a long-term perspective to support the development of Qatar and the wider region. 

**Explanation:**

While the text mentions the AIDIT team's focus on research and collaboration, it doesn't explicitly state a long-term vision for the region's development. The text focuses on:

* **Cancer research:** The AIDIT team is working on a project to identify men with a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.
* **Database development:** The team is building a database journal and a website to facilitate communication between researchers.
* **International collaboration:** The team is collaborating with international partners to share knowledge and experience.

The text does not provide information about the project's impact on the development of Qatar and the wider region, nor does it mention any plans to develop local and regional markets or strengthen links between energy-based economies and global financial markets. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the text does indeed support the development of Qatar and the wider region with a long-term perspective. However, the response provided goes into detail about the AIDIT team's focus on research and collaboration, which is not relevant to the question asked. The response fails to address the core of the question and does not align with the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 2
