[PROMPT]: Were the treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Ukraine?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not contain information about treaties signed with Ukraine in 1947 and 1948. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it implies there is no information about treaties signed with Ukraine in 1947 and 1948, which aligns with the reference answer "no." However, the response is more verbose and indirect compared to the straightforward reference answer. It does not directly answer the question with a simple "no," which would have been completely correct, accurate, and factual. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5.
[RESULT]: 3
