[PROMPT]: Is a kangaroo a reptile?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
No, a kangaroo is not a reptile. The text states that the study focuses on a comparative analysis of a new set of expressed genes of the red-eared slider turtle and orthologs of the turtle genes in mammalian, archosaurian, and amphibian genomes. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: no
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that a kangaroo is not a reptile, which is accurate and factual. However, the additional information about the study on the red-eared slider turtle and gene analysis is irrelevant to the question and does not contribute to the accuracy of the response. The extra details, while not incorrect, are unnecessary and detract from the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is mostly correct but not completely aligned with the reference answer's succinctness.
[RESULT]: 4
