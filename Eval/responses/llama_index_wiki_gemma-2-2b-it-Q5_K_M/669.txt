* **Multiple diminutive black spots throughout the distal duodenal bulb and second portion:** This refers to the appearance of the black spots on endoscopy.
* **Iron stainability within the mucosa is uneven and unpredictable:** This refers to the inconsistent presence of iron in the duodenal mucosa.
* **Multiple clinical conditions other than oral iron intake may be associated:** This refers to the possibility of other factors contributing to the black pigmentation.
