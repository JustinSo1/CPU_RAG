[PROMPT]: What are deposited in holes dug into mud or sand?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Based on the provided context, the answer is likely **soil samples**. 

Here's why:

* **Soil complexity, heterogeneity, and transferability:** The context mentions soil's importance in forensic investigations. This suggests soil samples are collected and analyzed for clues.
* **Multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (mqPCR):** This technique is used to analyze bacterial communities in soil samples.
* **Burkholderia pseudomallei:** The context discusses the presence of this bacterium in soil and its association with melioidosis. 
* **Iron Age and Roman inhumations:** The context mentions a site with Iron Age and Roman inhumations, suggesting soil samples were likely collected for analysis.


Therefore, based on the provided context, it's reasonable to assume that holes dug into mud or sand are used to collect soil samples.
