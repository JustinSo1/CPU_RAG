[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual. It provides a detailed explanation supporting the conclusion that it is likely a winter sports resort. However, the reference answer is a simple "Yes," which is a more direct and concise response. The evaluated response, while informative, goes beyond what is necessary and introduces some assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the reference answer. This makes it slightly less accurate in terms of matching the reference answer's simplicity and directness.
[RESULT]: 4
