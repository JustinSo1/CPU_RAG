Instead, it states that the provided text does not contain information about tusklessness, which is not relevant to the question itself. The reference answer is a simple "No," indicating that tusklessness has not become a rare abnormality. The evaluated response fails to provide this information and is therefore not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
