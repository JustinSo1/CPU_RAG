[PROMPT]: Do all ducks "quack"?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
No, the provided text does not mention anything about ducks quacking. 



[CORRECT_ANSWER]: No
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct in that it starts with "No," which aligns with the reference answer. However, the additional information about the provided text not mentioning anything about ducks quacking is unnecessary and deviates from the simplicity and directness of the reference answer. This extra detail makes the response less accurate and factual in the context of the given instruction.
[RESULT]: 3
