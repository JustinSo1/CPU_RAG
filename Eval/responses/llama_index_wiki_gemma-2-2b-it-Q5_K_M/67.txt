[PROMPT]: Is a beetle's general anatomy uniform?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
The provided text does not provide information about the general anatomy of beetles. It focuses on the phylogenetic relationships and brain structure of a specific species of beetle. 
Therefore, we cannot answer the query based on the given context. 

[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not directly answer the question about the general anatomy of beetles. Instead, it discusses the lack of information in the provided text, which is not relevant to the instruction. The reference answer is a simple "Yes," indicating that the general anatomy of beetles is uniform. The response fails to address this and is therefore not correct, accurate, or factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
