[PROMPT]: Is a kangaroo a marsupial from the family macropodidae -LRB- macropods , meaning (`` ` large foot ('' ' -RRB-?
[USER_ANSWER]: 
Yes. 
The text states: "Wallaroos (Macropus robustus robustus), which have the G6PD-F electrophoretic phenotype, crossed with euros (M.r.erubescens), of G6PD-S phenotype, produced F1 animals which had only the maternal G6PD type regardless of the direction of the cross." 
This indicates that wallaroos are a type of marsupial. 
The text also states: "The taxonomic status of U. yaschenkoi requires revision, and we provide recommendations for such future efforts." 
This indicates that U. yaschenkoi is a type of marsupial. 
The text also states: "A time-calibrated phylogeny dates the early divergence at the onset of continental-wide aridification in late Miocene and Pliocene, with finer-scale phylogeographic patterns emerging during the Pleistocene. This structuring dynamics is congruent with the diversification history of other fauna of the Australian arid zones." 
This indicates that kangaroos are a type of marsupial. 
The text also states: "The prediction of microRNA target analysis showed that several known microRNA targets, such as miR-10, miR-414 and miR-46
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: yes
[FEEDBACK]: The response starts with a correct and accurate answer, "Yes." However, the additional information provided is not directly relevant to the question about kangaroos being marsupials from the family macropodidae. The excerpts from the text discuss wallaroos, U. yaschenkoi, and phylogenetic studies, which do not directly address the specific question about kangaroos. Therefore, while the initial answer is correct, the additional information is not accurate or relevant to the question.
[RESULT]: 3
