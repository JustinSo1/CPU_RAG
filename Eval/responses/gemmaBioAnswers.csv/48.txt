[PROMPT]: Which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about which enzyme is targeted by Evolocumab, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a fully human monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that demonstrated marked reductions in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in statin-intolerant patients.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about the enzyme targeted by Evolocumab. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the information, which is not relevant to the question asked. The response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer, which clearly states that Evolocumab targets proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).
[RESULT]: 1
