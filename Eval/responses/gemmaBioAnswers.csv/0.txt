[PROMPT]: Is Hirschsprung disease a mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about whether Hirschsprung disease is a mendelian or a multifactorial disorder, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Coding sequence mutations in RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10 are involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease. The majority of these genes was shown to be related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease, whereas the non-Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non-syndromic Hirschsprung disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative model.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not address the question of whether Hirschsprung disease is a Mendelian or a multifactorial disorder. Instead, it states that the context does not provide information, which is not relevant to the evaluation criteria. The reference answer clearly explains the genetic basis of Hirschsprung disease, indicating both Mendelian and multifactorial aspects. The response fails to provide any of this information, making it completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
