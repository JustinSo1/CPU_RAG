[PROMPT]: What is the association of estrogen replacement therapy and intracranial meningioma risk?
[USER_ANSWER]: The association of estrogen replacement therapy and intracranial meningioma risk is statistically significant.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The association between hormone replacement therapy and meningioma risk is controversial. Increased risk of meningioma was demonstrated in estrogen-only hormonal replacement therapy. However, other studies did not find an association between hormonal replacement therapy and meningioma risk.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is somewhat correct and accurate but lacks the depth and detail provided in the reference answer. The reference answer highlights the controversy and variability in study results regarding the association between hormone replacement therapy and meningioma risk, whereas the response only mentions that the association is statistically significant without acknowledging the complexity and differing study outcomes.
[RESULT]: 3
