[PROMPT]: What are the effects of depleting protein  km23-1 (DYNLRB1)  in a cell?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the effects of depleting protein km23-1 (DYNLRB1) in a cell, hence I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The knockdown of km23-1 results in numerous effects at the cellular level, such as decreased cell migration. Additionaly, km23-1 is involved in signalling pathways and its knockdown results in decreased RhoA activation, inhibition of TGFÎ²-mediated activation of ERK and JNK, phosphorylation of c-Jun, transactivation of the c-Jun promoter and decreased TGFbeta responses.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about the effects of depleting protein km23-1 (DYNLRB1) in a cell. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the necessary information to answer the question. This is completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer, which details specific cellular effects such as decreased cell migration, involvement in signaling pathways, and various molecular activations and inhibitions.
[RESULT]: 1
