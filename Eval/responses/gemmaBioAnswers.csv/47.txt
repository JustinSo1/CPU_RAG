[PROMPT]: Is Weaver syndrome similar to Sotos?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about how similar Weaver syndrome is to Sotos syndrome, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Overgrowth conditions are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by increased growth and variable features, including macrocephaly, distinctive facial appearance and various degrees of learning difficulties and intellectual disability. Among them, Sotos and Weaver syndromes are clinically well defined and due to heterozygous mutations in NSD1 and EZH2, respectively. NSD1 and EZH2 are both histone-modifying enzymes
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any factual information about the similarity between Weaver syndrome and Sotos syndrome. It simply states that the context does not provide information, which is not an accurate or factual answer to the question. The reference answer provides detailed information about the similarities between the two syndromes, including their classification as overgrowth conditions, their clinical definitions, and the genetic mutations involved. The evaluated response fails to address any of these points and does not provide any correct, accurate, or factual information based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
