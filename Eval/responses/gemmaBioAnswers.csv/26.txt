HILIC is a chromatography technique that is used for the analysis of small polar molecules.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC)

However, it does not provide the full name "Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography," which is a key part of the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is mostly correct and factual, it lacks completeness in terms of the full name of the technique.
[RESULT]: 4
