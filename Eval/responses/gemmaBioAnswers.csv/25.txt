[PROMPT]: Which proteins participate in the formation of the ryanodine receptor quaternary macromolecular complex?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the proteins that participate in the formation of the ryanodine receptor quaternary macromolecular complex, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Junctin is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), triadin, and calsequestrin.   
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any information about the proteins that participate in the formation of the ryanodine receptor quaternary macromolecular complex. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the necessary information, which is not relevant to the question. The response is completely incorrect and does not align with the reference answer, which lists specific proteins involved in the complex.
[RESULT]: 1
