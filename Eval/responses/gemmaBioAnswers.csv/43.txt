[PROMPT]: What is evaluated using the EORTC QLQ – INFO25 questionnaire?
[USER_ANSWER]: The EORTC QLQ – INFO25 questionnaire evaluates the quality of life (QoL) of patients with advanced cancer. It is a comprehensive questionnaire that covers various domains of QoL, including physical, emotional, social, and spiritual well-being.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Group information questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-INFO 25) evaluates the level of information patients have received in different areas of their disease, treatment and care, and evaluates qualitative aspects together with satisfaction with information.
[FEEDBACK]: The response is mostly incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer. The EORTC QLQ – INFO25 questionnaire does not evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of patients with advanced cancer. Instead, it evaluates the level of information patients have received regarding their disease, treatment, and care, as well as their satisfaction with this information. The response fails to mention these key aspects and incorrectly focuses on QoL domains such as physical, emotional, social, and spiritual well-being, which are not the primary focus of the EORTC QLQ – INFO25.
[RESULT]: 2
