[PROMPT]: What is the effect of ivabradine in heart failure after myocardial infarction?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the effect of ivabradine in heart failure after myocardial infarction, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Ιvabradine decreases heart rate and reduces myocardial oxygen demand, increases diastolic perfusion time and improves energetics in ischemic myocardium. Ivabradine protects the myocardium during ischemia, improves left ventricular function in heart failure and reduces remodeling following myocardial infarction. It improves prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction and heart rate ≥70 beats per minute, as well as in patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. The beneficial effects of ivabradine may be due to the reversal of electrophysiological cardiac remodelling in post-MI rats by reduction of functional overexpression of HCN channels. Furthermore, the improvement of cardiac function is related not only to the HR reduction per se but also to modifications in the extracellular matrix.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide any information about the effect of ivabradine in heart failure after myocardial infarction. Instead, it states that the context does not provide the necessary information to answer the question. This is not aligned with the reference answer, which provides detailed and accurate information about the effects of ivabradine. Therefore, the response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and not factual based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
