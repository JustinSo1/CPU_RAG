[PROMPT]: What is the mode of inheritance of Wilson's disease?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, the mode of inheritance of Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. This means that the disease is caused by a mutation in a gene that is located on an autosome, which is a sex chromosome. Autosomal recessive disorders are caused by mutations in genes that are located on the chromosomes of one parent.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder.
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies the mode of inheritance of Wilson's disease as autosomal recessive, which aligns with the reference answer. However, the explanation provided contains inaccuracies. Specifically, it incorrectly states that an autosome is a sex chromosome, which is not true. Autosomes are non-sex chromosomes. Additionally, the explanation about autosomal recessive disorders being caused by mutations in genes located on the chromosomes of one parent is misleading; both parents must carry and pass on the mutated gene for the disorder to manifest in the offspring. These inaccuracies affect the overall correctness and factual accuracy of the response.
[RESULT]: 3
