[PROMPT]: Is Alu hypomethylation associated with breast cancer?
[USER_ANSWER]: Sure, Alu hypomethylation is associated with breast cancer. The context states that Alu hypomethylation correlated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) status, while LINE-1 hypomethylation was associated with negative ER status, ERBB2 (HER2) amplification and p53 overexpression.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes, Alu elements were found to be hypomethylated in breast cancer, especially in the HER2-enriched subtype. Furthermore, Alu hypomethylation was identified as a late event during breast cancer progression, and in invasive breast cancer, tended to be associated with negative estrogen receptor status and poor disease-free survival of the patients.
[FEEDBACK]: The response correctly identifies that Alu hypomethylation is associated with breast cancer and mentions its correlation with negative estrogen receptor (ER) status. However, it inaccurately states that LINE-1 hypomethylation is associated with negative ER status, which is not mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, the response does not mention the association of Alu hypomethylation with the HER2-enriched subtype, its identification as a late event during breast cancer progression, or its association with poor disease-free survival, which are key points in the reference answer. Therefore, the response is somewhat correct but lacks several important details and includes some inaccuracies.
[RESULT]: 3
