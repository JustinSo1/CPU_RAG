[PROMPT]: Proteomic analyses need prior knowledge of the organism complete genome. Is the complete genome of the bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter available?
[USER_ANSWER]: The context does not provide any information about the availability of the complete genome of Arthrobacter sp. B6, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.
[CORRECT_ANSWER]: Yes, the complete genome sequence of Arthrobacter (two strains) is deposited in GenBank.
[FEEDBACK]: The response does not provide the correct information regarding the availability of the complete genome of Arthrobacter. The reference answer clearly states that the complete genome sequence of Arthrobacter (two strains) is available in GenBank, while the response claims that the context does not provide this information and thus does not answer the question. This makes the response completely incorrect and inaccurate based on the reference answer.
[RESULT]: 1
