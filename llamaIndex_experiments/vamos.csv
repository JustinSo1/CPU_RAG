This is a good start, but it could be improved. Here's a more complete and nuanced answer:

**Grant believed the Mexican War was unjust because he saw it as a war of aggression against a weaker nation, and he felt it was a violation of international law.**

Here's why this is a better answer:

* **More specific:** It mentions the war's nature as ""aggression"" and ""violation of international law,"" providing more context and depth to his reasoning.
* **More nuanced:** It acknowledges the complexity of the situation, recognizing that Grant was ""bitterly opposed"" to the war, but also understanding the broader context of international relations and the potential for war. 
* **More complete:** It connects Grant's personal feelings to his understanding of the war's broader implications.


This revised answer provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of Grant's views on the Mexican War.
